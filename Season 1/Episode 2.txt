44) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Nếu ta may mắn we'd bring in a Sturgeon  hoặc hai, nhưng trời... Chưa từng ở ngoài đại dương.
45) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Trời, nó nghe có vẻ thích! Bố thường dẫn chúng tôi đi cho miệng bass lớn khi chúng tôi còn là đứa trẻ.
46) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Về mặt thương mại, phần lớn là vây của Snapper và Yellow. Nhưng vào mùa hè tôi sẽ dẫn khách tham quan đi bắt cá!
47) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Tôi bảo anh, không có gì ngon bằng con cá hồi tươi thẳng từ đại dương ra - vào nướng - vào cái đĩa!!  Nhất là cách Kate nấu nó!

[ambient conversation]Tôi gặp Ken sau khi tôi mở văn phòng dành cho cựu chiến binh và anh ấy xông vào với một con bạch tuộc bị ốm!
49) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Hả?  Tôi có thể mang nó đi đâu?
50) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Cô từ đâu vậy Katjaa?  Giọng đó chắc chắn không phải từ Georgia!
51) KATJAA
[ambient conversation][friendly]Không, chắc chắn không rồi! Gia đình tôi từ Belgium, nhưng tôi chuyển tới Florida khi tôi đang trong tuổi thiếu niên.
52) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Dan, có phải anh luôn làm việc tại cái nông trại này à?

54) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Tôi nghe vậy.
55) DANNY

57) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Decatur?

70) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Tôi làm trong văn phòng cựu chiến binh khi còn ở tuổi thiếu niên, sau đó có được bằng một vài năm sau đó.
71) KATJAA

80) KENNY

82) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Cảm ơn một lần nữa vì bữa ăn.  Mọi người không biết nó đã được từ bao giờ!
83) KENNY

88) LARRY
[ambient conversation]Con trai, cậu không bao giờ hỏi một người lính câu hỏi đó, rõ chưa?
89) LARRY
[ambient conversation]Tất cả những gì cậu cần làm là đừng địt với cô ấy. Chấm hết.
90) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Bố...
114) LILLY
[panicked] BỐ?!
91) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Ừ, tôi rất tiếc.
92) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Đừng để ý tới anh tôi.  Anh ấy luôn làm một cái sở thích thích ngậm ngùi lời nói của mình.
93) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Vậy mọi người biết nhau từ trước à?
94) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Không. Bọn tôi kiểu tìm thấy nhau.
95) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Nhưng chúng ta nên đi cùng nhau nếu muốn sống.
96) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Tôi nghe.  Mọi người nên biết khi hi sinh cho cái tốt hơn, biết không.
97) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Nó không đúng chút nào.  Không đứa trẻ nào nên thấy điều bọn nó thấy.
98) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Bọn trẻ rất kiên cường, anh biết không?  Tôi ghét khi mà bọn trẻ phải lớn lên như thế này, nhưng mà dưới tình hình hiện tại, Tôi nghĩ bọn nó đang làm rất tốt.
99) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Bọn trẻ đang xử lý với ...mọi thứ như thế nào rồi?
100) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Chúng ta có nên kiểm tra anh ây không?
101) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Hãy để anh ấy rửa đồ đi. Anh ấy sẽ xong trong một phút mà.
102) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Chúng ta sẽ sớm ăn thôi đúng không, mẹ?
103) LARRY
[ambient conversation]Cậu rửa tay mất bao lâu?
104) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Ngay sau khi Lee quay lại.

[ambient conversation]Ừ, Maybelle là con duy nhất ta còn.
106) DANNY
[ambient conversation][cont.] Cô ấy cung ấy cấp sữa đó.
107) CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]Cháu thích bò.  Cô ấy trông rất xing.
108) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Đó là tại sao ta cần sự giúp đỡ của Katjaa.
109) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Bọn tôi muốn một con bê khoẻ mạnh, nhưng phần lớn bọn tôi muốn maybelle ổn.
110) LEE

145) ANDY
{happyC}Walkers? {happyB}Is that what you call them? That's good. [beat] {normalC}The old one wouldn't have, but Mac -- he was our foreman -- {happyA}he figured out how to amp it up with the generators.
146) ANDY
{happyB}We used to sit out here some nights and watch the sons o' bitches sizzle and pop when they got too close.
147) ANDY

148) LEE

{normalC}{body-a}These generators are enough to power the whole dairy?
2) LEE
{normalD}{body-c}Is it just the three of you here?
3) ANDY
{normalA}{body-handships}'Fraid so. {sadA}We lost Daddy the first month.
4) ANDY
{angryA}{body-a}Then we had some run-ins with the fuckin' bandits about a month and a half ago, {sadA}killed one of the hands.
5) ANDY
{angryA}{body-a}Then HE came back and took out the rest of the hands before we could stop him.
6) LEE
{thinkingB}{body-c}An electric fence is enough to keep out walkers?
7) ANDY
{happyC}{body-a}Walkers? {happyB}Is that what you call them? That's good. [beat] {normalC}{body-handships}The old one wouldn't have, but Mac -- {body-a}he was our foreman -- {happyA}he figured out how to amp it up with the generators.
8) ANDY
{happyB}We used to sit out here some nights and watch the sons o' bitches sizzle and pop when they got too close.
9) ANDY
{happyA}Closest thing to entertainment these days, I guess.
10) ANDY
[pickup1][stern.  Seriously not letting Lee in the house with a weapon]Lee, I'm serious.  Leave your axe out here.
11) LEE
[pickup1]We're not leaving our weapons out here.
12) ANDY
[pickup1][kindly insisting they leave their weapons outside]Look, I'm not trying to be a prick, but that's Momma's rule.  You wanna eat, you do what she says.
13) LARRY
[pickup1][annoyed that Lee is beings stubborn about laying down his weapon]Get a move on, Lee. I'm starving!
14) LEE
[pickup1][not sure that leaving their weapons outside is a good idea]I'd feel better if we could keep our weapons with us.
15) ANDY
[pickup1]If it were up to me, that'd be fine.  But it's Momma's rule, and if you wanna eat, ya better do what she wants.
16) LEE
[pickup1][asking for a reminder]Where should we put our weapons before going inside?
17) ANDY
[pickup1][motioning to where Lee & Larry and leave their weapons] Right there will be fine.
18) LEE
{normalb}{body-a}[pickup2] Fellas.
19) ANDY
{sada}{body-a}[pickup2] I'm really sorry about your friend. {normalb}The last thing any of us want is for someone to get hurt out there.
20) ANDY
{sada}{body-a}[pickup2] How are ya feelin', Lee? I'm really sorry you almost got killed out there. {thinkinga}We should have told you how dangerous it was.
21) LEE
{normalc}{body-b}[pickup2][irritated]I still don't understand why {angrya}you turned the fence on.
22) ANDY
{normalb}{body-a}[pickup2] That was just a miscommunication, honest. {sada}I feel real bad about that.
23) LEE
{normalb}{body-b}[pickup2] What else is there to know about those bandits out there?
24) LEE
[pickup2]{normalc}Mark's alive. {angryb}Just glad it wasn't worse.
25) ANDY
[pickup2] {happyb}Don't worry, Mama will take good care of him.
26) LEE
{angryb}{body-b}[pickup2] Mark's death might have been avoided if {angryc}y'all had just told us what was out there.
27) ANDY
{thinkinga}{body-a}[pickup2]We didn't mean to hide anything from you, Lee. {sada}Honest.
28) DANNY
{normalc}{body-a}[pickup2] [shrugging it off]Accidents are gonna happen. {normalb}But we can't let this slide.
29) DANNY
{alias } {angryA}You saw what they did to your buddy. {normalB}Nobody's safe here until we start to fight back.
30) LEE
{normalC}How?
31) DANNY
{normalC}It's cool.  {normalB}You don't have to decide right now.  {normalA}But don't wait too long, or you may not have a choice.
32) ANDY
{normalb}{body-a}[pickup2] I'll stay here and hold down the fort.
33) DANNY
{normalC}Remember: we're just doing reconnaissance for now. No use getting ourselves killed.
34) ANDY
[pickup2] {happyb}Hell, yeah.
35) DANNY
[pickup2]{normalc}The two of us should go out and do some recon, {happyc}then we'll all mount up for some revenge.
36) DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] Changed your mind about goin' out to track down those bandits?
37) DANNY
{angrya}{body-a} [pickup2]Look, ain't no point in spreading the blame around here.
38) ANDY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2]Hey, Lee.
39) LEE
[pickup2] {angrya}No shit.
40) ANDY
[pickup2] {normalb}{body-a}Hi.
41) LEE
{normala}{body-b}[pickup2] Hi...
98) LEE
{normala}{body-b}[pickup2] Hi...
42) ANDY
[pickup2] {happyd}{body-handships}I'm glad you guys decided to help us out.
43) LEE
{normalb}{body-c}[pickup2] I'm gonna get to know the place for a minute.
44) ANDY
[pickup2] {thinkinga}{body-a}Okay, well, we gotta secure the perimeter {normalb}so don't take too long!
45) LEE
[pickup2] {happya}{body-b}Mark and I can help you with that perimeter, now.
46) ANDY
[pickup2] {normalb}I'll turn off the northwest section, {thinkinga}and if you guys could {normalc}strip 'em off and look for any weak points, {happyb}that'd be a big help.
47) ANDY
[pickup2]{angrya} Stay attentive, ya never know.
48) LEE
[pickup2] {normala}Okay...
49) ANDY
[pickup2] Oh, good. The fence stops a walker in about three or four seconds, but gets overloaded if we leave the husks out there.
50) LEE
[pickup2] {happya}Sounds easy enough.
51) ANDY
[pickup2] {happyc}{body-a}We got lots. {normalb}And we gotta keep trading for fuel as much as we can. {happya}But they all work together to do the trick. {happyc}Like us.
52) 
The fence stops the walkers?
53) 
Let's go.
54) 
Not now.
55) LEE
[pickup2] That fence line was a suicide mission.
56) ANDY
{sada}{body-a}[pickup2] We really are sorry.
57) ANDY
{thinkinga}{body-a}[pickup2] We don't know. We think some of 'em used to work at the big box up the way.
58) LEE
{angryc}{body-b}[pickup2] Who the fuck are these people in the woods?
59) ANDY
[pickup2] {normala}Yeah. Anyway, they're {angrya}nutty as hell. And get mad when they're hungry.
60) DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] Save Lots.
61) LEE
[pickup2]{angryb}My girl's in there.
62) ANDY
{thinkinga}{body-a}[pickup2] She's with that doctor, right? {happya}Don't worry about her. {normalb}The house is a mess and we'll get ya'll in for {normalc}dinner when mama's ready.
63) DANNY
{happyc}{body-a}[pickup2] You gotta drain the snake er somethin? {happya}Go 'round to the bushes.
64) LEE
{angrya}{body-b}[pickup2] I'd like to go inside.
65) ANDY
{sada}{body-a}[pickup2] I hear ya, but ya know, {thinkinga}she's probably safest in there for now, with {surpriseda}arrows flyin', {normalc}right?
66) LEE
{angryc}{body-b}[pickup2] I'm not happy about being out here away from my girl.
67) DANNY
{angrya}{body-a}[pickup2] Well, we better go after them bandits soon. {normalc}Come back when you're ready.
68) LEE
{angrya}{body-b}[pickup2] I'm gonna go have a look around.
69) 
{normalC}Si pueden averiguar cómo meterse y arreglarlo, sería de gran ayuda.
70) 
Estoy listo para asegurar el perímetro.
71) 
¿Necesitaban ayuda con el cerco?
72) DANNY
[pickup3]So, are ya ready to head out there and find their camp?
73) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Are you going now?
74) LEE
[pickup3]Yeah.  I'll be back soon, Clementine.
75) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Please be lucky.
76) LEE
[pickup3]I will.
77) 
Are we your first guests?
78) LEE
[pickup3]We can't be the first people you've invited up to the dairy.
79) ANDY
[pickup3]Well, no. We've made similar deals with other folks, trading for gas and food, but ultimately they moved on, looking for the people they lost contact with.
80) LEE
[pickup3]You know, Mark and I can clear the fence ourselves if you want to stay here and finish up with the generators.
81) ANDY
[pickup3][precceds 310485152]Well, that'd be great!
82) 
Let's go fix the perimeter.
83) ANDY
[pickup3]I noticed back at the motel that you folks are pretty well armed.  You been stockpiling, huh?
84) 
No one fucks with us.
85) 
We can help protect the dairy.
86) 
How many weapons do YOU have?
87) LEE
[pickup3]Yeah.  If anyone tries to fuck with us they'll regret it!
88) ANDY
[pickup3][a bit put off]Well, protecting your people is important, but in my experience, having that many guns around is when people get dangerous.
89) ANDY
[pickup3]Hopefully it'll never come to that, but thanks.
90) LEE
[pickup3]Yeah, if you need extra people to protect the dairy, you can count on us!
91) LEE
[pickup3] We've scraped together a good supply in the last few months. How about yourselves? What kind of protection do you have around here?
92) ANDY
[pickup3] We've collected a few guns to protect ourselves, but we really only use em' when we go off the property. When we're inside the perimeter, the fence is all we need to keep us safe.
93) LEE
[pickup3] Yeah.  It'll be a good opportunity to find out a bit more about what we're up against. Let's do it.
94) LEE
[pickup3] Yeah. We've gotta work together on this. Those bandits are a danger to all. Let's do it.
95) LEE
[pickup3] I'll do that.
96) LEE
[pickup3] We'll go in a few minutes, I just need to check on a few things before we head out.
97) ANDY
[pickup3] Sure, that's understandable. Talk things over with your group, just come find us when you're ready.
99) 
{alias } {angryA}Tu as vu ce qu'ils ont fait à ton copain. {normalB}Tant qu'on ne contre-attaquera pas, personne ne sera à l'abri.

Sittin' out here, looking over the farm, I can pretend that things are like they used to be.
2) BRENDA
[pickup2]That's the world we're living in now, I guess.
3) LEE
{normald}I'd still like to check on him.

Just you wait, Lee, things are gonna seem so much nicer once you've all had supper and a good night's rest.

How's Mark doing in there?
11) BRENDA
[pickup2]{normalA}Best patient I ever had. My boys get so much as a scratch and start hollerin'. {happya}He could definitely teach them a thing or two about being tough.
12) LEE
[pickup2]Not to be rude, ma'am, how come you're out here instead of, you know...
13) LEE
[pickup2] No no, I didn't mean for it to sound like that.
14) BRENDA
[pickup2][jovial]Ha, you wanna know why I'm not slaving away in the kitchen, is that it?
15) BRENDA
[pickup2]It's okay, darlin'. Got it slow cookin' in the oven. Should be ready before too long!
16) BRENDA
[pickup2]It's nothin' interesting, I can promise you that much. Just some odds and ends. Takes a lot to run a farm, you know.
17) BRENDA
[pickup2]Well, someone's gettin' a little curious, aren't they?
18) LEE
[pickup2]I don't mean to pry.
19) LEE
[pickup2]So, what do y'all keep in that barn back there? Besides cows, I mean.
20) BRENDA
[pickup2]I was just glad you two weren't hurt. Those bandits just don't know when to quit. But my boys... they can hold their own.
21) LEE
[pickup2]We ran into some trouble out there.

We ran into some trouble out there.
22) LEE
[pickup2]{normald}You been getting along with Larry?
23) BRENDA
[pickup2]{happya}He's just a big ol' sweetheart, ain't he?
24) LEE
[pickup2]{thinkinga}Don't know if I would have used those words, exactly.
25) BRENDA
[pickup2]{normala}Don't judge, honey. This world is bringin' out the worst in people. But if you really look, you'll catch a glimpse of humanity every now and then.
26) BRENDA
[pickup2]Kinda peaceful out here, ain't it? Enjoy it while you can. You'll probably start hearing those monsters fryin' against the fence before too long.
27) LEE
[pickup2]Think I'll go have a look around.
28) BRENDA
[pickup2]Don't wander too far. Dinner will be ready before you know it.
29) LEE
[pickup2] I can't believe Mark is dead. One second we're talking about your place here, the next he's got an arrow in him.
30) BRENDA
[pickup2] Oh child, I'm so sorry. We've seen some horrible violence here. But I promise ya'll are safe.
31) 
Why are you out here instead of cooking?
32) 
What do guys keep in the barn?
33) 
Your boy is nuts.
34) 
Why do you deal with bandits?
35) 
We met a woman at the camp...
36) LEE
[pickup2] He seemed to enjoy this woman's death.
37) LEE
[pickup2] Your boy Danny is nuts.
38) BRENDA
[pickup2] That's not a very nice thing to say, Lee.
39) BRENDA
[pickup2] I'm sure he didn't. He is sensitive and willing to do whatever it takes to protect this place.
40) LEE
[pickup2] Why did you make a deal with those people?
41) BRENDA
[pickup2] We got a thread of humanity left, Lee. We can do more good without them in our hair by placatin' em, so that's what we do.
42) LEE
[pickup2] What does that have to do with anything?
43) BRENDA
[pickup2] Means you can't trust 'em. Any of 'em.
44) LEE
[pickup2] She wasn't one of the "bandits." It sounds like they did something pretty bad to her and your marauders are still out there.
45) LEE
[pickup2] Before she died, we met a woman out there, at her camp.
51) LEE
[pickup2] Before she died, we met a woman out there, at her camp.

54) 
How many rooms in this house?
55) BRENDA
[pickup3]{happyA}I think with Danny's help I've got things pretty well squared away in the kitchen, but feel free to check with Andy. He's got a lot of weight on his shoulders these days so I'm sure he'd love any help he can get.
56) LEE
[pickup3]{normalA}Can I help you with anything around the house.
57) BRENDA

It looks custom built.

Sorry, that was rude.

66) BRENDA
[pickup3][slightly offended]{angrya}Let's not start thinking too far ahead now.  {happya}[then friendly]Let's just focus on gettin' y'all a good home cooked meal tonight.
67) BRENDA
[pickup3][happy nostalgic]{happyc}Nice of you to notice.  My husband put a lot of work into this old house.
68) LEE
[pickup3]{happya}Well, he did a fantastic job.
69) LEE
[pickup3][admiring]{happya}It looks custom built.

[pickup3]{sadA}I'm sorry.  That was rude of me.

72) BRENDA
[pickup3]{happyb} I believe in making a house a home.

[pickup3] {happya}Your family has done an amazing job of keeping this place up.
74) BRENDA

78) BRENDA
[pickup3] {sadA}The few that stuck around... well... {sadc}we lost most of 'em the first night those things showed up here.  It was... a tough night.
79) LEE
[pickup3] {normalC}How has your family been holding up since ...you know?
80) BRENDA
[pickup3]{normalA}I think it was hardest on Andy.  Dan was always more of a mama's boy, {happya}but don't tell him I said that!  [chuckles]
81) BRENDA
[pickup3] {normalB}My boys have been my saving grace. They both left their jobs and came home to help out after the attacks started happening.

The place looks amazing.

What happened to your staff?

How is your family holding up?

[pickup3][Duck reallly want to get back on the swing]Okay, Duck, don't pop a gasket.
66) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Lee!  Will you push me?

1) DANNY
{normalC}Remember: we're just doing reconnaissance for now. No use getting ourselves killed.
2) DANNY
{normalC}What do you think of the place?
3) LEE
{normalA}It's beautiful.
4) LEE
{normalC}How?
5) DANNY
{normalC}It's cool.  {normalB}You don't have to decide right now.  {normalA}But don't wait too long, or you may not have a choice.
6) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Hi ya, Trigger.
7) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Glad I got to use her today.
8) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}My girl, here.
9) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Hello.
10) 
You really like that gun.
14) LEE
{normalA}[pickup2] You really like that gun.
11) 
What's with the wheelbarrow?
12) 
This place is isolated.
13) 
You run this place with just one cow?
15) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}What's not to like?
16) 
Not much, I guess.
20) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}Not much, I guess.
17) 
It's just a gun.
22) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}It's just a gun.
18) 
Just kinda creepy, that's all.
23) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}Just kinda creepy, that's all.
19) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Exactly.
21) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}That's where you're wrong. This is Charlotte. She's as faithful as a starvin' hound when you got a bone in your pocket.
24) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Times like these, a .243 will keep you warmer at night than any lady I ever known.
25) DANNY
[pickup2] Things happen on a dairy. Cut myself darn bad just the other day. Blood everywhere.
26) DANNY
[pickup2] I'm tough.
27) LEE
[pickup2] I saw a wheelbarrow over there, full of garbage. Some bloody clothes.
28) LEE
[pickup2] You seem okay.
29) LEE
[pickup2] You guys are pretty out in the sticks, here.
30) LEE
[pickup2] You get many visitors?
31) DANNY
[pickup2] Not anymore. Bandits, of course. Used to get these school kids on tours back before the dead time.
32) DANNY
[pickup2] [creepy] [we are] Hard to find.
33) LEE
[pickup2] [a little on edge]That right?
34) DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] Used to have more. They get hungry, too. Or sick. Got your doctor friend here now, though.
35) LEE
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] How do you run this place with just one cow?
36) LEE
[pickup2] You guys must trade for a LOT of fuel to keep the generators running, right?
37) DANNY
[pickup2] People get hungry and a few loaves of bread fetch a high price. Ya'll are lucky you're on this side of the deal now.
38) DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] It'll be a good one.
39) LEE
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] I'm going to go wait for supper, then.

1) KENNY
{sadA}Hey, {normalB}they said Mark got attacked?
2) LEE
{normalD}Don't worry, he's fine.
3) KENNY
{normalB}He'd better be. We need him.
4) LEE
{angryA}Bandits attacked us.
5) KENNY
{angryA}God dammit. {thinkingA}Didn't think they'd come all the way out here.
6) KENNY
{normalA}Least he didn't get bit, I guess.
7) LEE
{thinkingA}I haven't seen him since.
8) KENNY
{normalA}Hmm, should I ask Kat {normalB}to look in on him when she's done with the cow?
9) KENNY
{normalB}Maybe, maybe not. Once we get our food, we can do a better job of defending it.
10) KENNY
{thinkingA}Instead of just waitin' around at the motel for somebody to attack us or eat us.
11) LEE
{thinkingA}This place isn't safe.
12) LEE
{happyA}I'm glad you decided to come out with us.
13) KENNY
{normalB}Yeah, well, we need the food.  {normalA}Helping this cow better be worth it.
14) KENNY
[worried] {angryA}I noticed there weren't too many walkers around on the way up.
15) LEE
{normalD}That's good.
16) KENNY
{normalA}Is it? I got a bad feeling.
17) KENNY
{angryA}Whether it's from the walkers or the bandits, there's a shitstorm comin'.
18) LEE
{normalC}Something wrong with that?
19) KENNY
{angryA}If we ain't seeing 'em, that means either there's a shitload of 'em waiting somewhere...
20) KENNY
...or else somebody with a lot more firepower than us is killin' 'em off.
21) KENNY
{normalA}Either way, I gotta bad feeling a shitstorm's brewin'.
22) LEE
{normalD}The walkers don't worry me as much as the bandits.
23) KENNY
{normalB}That's what I'm sayin'.
24) KENNY
{fearA}Somethin's coming, Lee. There's gonna be a war.
25) KENNY
{sadA}On the way over here, I was gettin' dizzy, hands shakin', cold sweats. {normalA}Thought I was gonna pass out.
26) LEE
{normalD}They've got food here.
27) KENNY
{angryA}I hope they feed us, Lee. Soon.
28) KENNY
{thinkingA}Yeah, but I'm not just talking about one meal, ya know?
29) LEE
{normalC}How you holding up?
75) 
How you holding up?
30) KENNY
[quietly] {angryA}If they got a supply of food somewhere, {normalA}we've gotta know where it is and how to get it.
31) KENNY
[quietly] {sadA}In case something happens.
32) KENNY
{normalB}Katjaa knows what's up, talk to her and she'll show you where I'm talking about.
33) KENNY
{angryA}Find out what's in that room.
34) LEE
[quietly] {thinkingA}I still don't like it.
35) KENNY
{sadA}Come on, Lee, it's not just us. We've gotta think of the kids.
36) KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}You don't have to like it, just do it.
37) LEE
[quietly] {thinkingA}You're right.
38) LEE
[quietly] {normalB}It's probably nothing. {normalC}What could they be hiding at a dairy farm?
39) KENNY
[quietly] {thinkingA}Food!
40) LEE
[quietly] {angryA}These folks deserve their privacy.
41) KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}We just want to look, Lee. We're not stealing anything.
42) LEE
[quietly] {angryA}We can't piss these people off, Kenny. We need them to trust us.
43) KENNY
[quietly] {normalA}That goes both ways, Lee.
44) LEE
[quietly] {angryA}You want ME to take a look?
45) KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}Exactly.
46) LEE
{normalA}Bye.
47) KENNY
{happyA}Hey, Lee. {normalA}Nice place, huh?
48) KENNY
{normalA}So, uh... what's up?
49) KENNY
[after being ignored]{sadA}Well... just be careful, I guess.
50) LEE
{normalA}Hi, Kenny.
51) LEE
[greeting]{normalB}Hey...
86) LEE
[greeting]{normalB}Hey...
52) KENNY
[noticing Lee's silence]{angryA}You sense it too, don't ya?   {fearA}Man, I've got a feeling something bad is on the horizon, Lee.
53) KENNY
[responding to Lee's silence; hushed][quietly]  {angryA}Well don't look at me!  {thinkingA}I'm no good at breaking and entering.  But somebody's gotta do it!
54) KENNY
{normalB}What's up, Lee?
55) KENNY
[looks at Danny] {normalB}Mind if I talk to Lee for a minute?
56) KENNY
[looks at Danny] {normalB}Gimme a sec...
57) DANNY
{normalB}Yeah, go ahead.
58) LEE
[pickup2] I guess Lilly isn't too thrilled about being here.
59) KENNY
[pickup2] I could give two shits about what Lilly wants. Duck and Katjaa need food, and I'm not about to sit around that Motor Inn and watch them go hungry.
60) LEE
[pickup2] If everything works out, maybe he and Katjaa can have an easier life here.
61) KENNY
[pickup2][bitter]Yeah, right.
62) LEE
[pickup2] That's in the past, Kenny. A lot's happened since then.
63) KENNY
[pickup2] [bitter]That's funny, you didn't seem too worried about Duck when Larry wanted to throw him out into the street back in Macon.
64) KENNY
[pickup2] [bitter] That's funny, considering you didn't seem too worried about Duck back at Hershel's Farm.
65) KENNY
[pickup2] I hope you're right. Duck and Clementine deserve a better life than starving to death at some crappy motel.
66) LEE
[pickup2] I'm gonna go have a look around.
67) KENNY
[pickup2] I'll be here if you need me. Let me know if you find anything.
68) KENNY
[pickup2]Well, it wasn't easy. Duck didn't look so good on the walk over to this place.
69) LEE
[pickup2] Did Duck and Katjaa get here okay?
70) LEE
[pickup2]Kenny?
71) LEE
[pickup2] I still can't get that lock off the door.
72) KENNY
[pickup2][reminder] Hmmm.  You probably just need a screwdriver or something.
73) 
Lilly doesn't want to be here.
74) 
Your family made it here okay?
76) KENNY
[pickup3][follows # 310481005]You're with me on this, right?
77) LEE
[pickup3][agreeing with Kenny that Lilly is wrong about the motor inn]Yeah, of course.  Lilly's judgement is clouded, but you've got a pretty clear head about these things.
78) LEE
[pickup3][disagreeing with Kenny about the motor inn]Lilly's been doing a good job of keeping the group together.  You need to back off a bit.
79) LEE
[pickup3][not siding with anyone about the motor inn]You're not making me pick sides, Kenny.
80) KENNY
[pickup3][disapointed in Lee for siding with Lilly] Whatever.
81) KENNY
[pickup3][in ernest]Well... you better think about it, because that time is coming.
82) 
Yeah, of course.
83) 
No. Lilly's been doing a good job.
84) 
I'm not choosing sides.
85) KENNY
[pickup3][responding to Lee's silence and refusal to pick sides] Hmf.  Always the diplomat.
87) KENNY
[pickup3] Hey Lee, found anything interesting?
88) KENNY
[pickup3] Good to know. Keep your ears open for anything else that might help us.
89) LEE
[pickup3] I'm just trying to make sure this place is secure, in case we decide to make this a more long term solution.  Except for those people in the woods, it seems pretty safe.
90) KENNY
[pickup3] That's true.  Well, it's good to know what we're working with here.
91) KENNY
[pickup3] Keep looking around and let me know if you find anything else.
92) LEE
[pickup3] I was talking to Andy a bit earlier, it doesn't sound like they have too many guns around. They rely mostly on the fence to keep them safe.
93) LEE
[pickup3] Well that's the problem, when there's no more gas, there's no more fence.
94) KENNY
[pickup3] Hey Lee, how's it going with the St. Johns?
95) LEE
[pickup3] Good. I was talking to Andy earlier and offered our group's assistance on the dairy.
96) KENNY
[pickup3] Great. Sounds like they're starting to accept us.
97) LEE
[pickup3] Definitely.
98) LEE
[pickup3]I don't think they have much to protect them besides the fence so he seemed pretty appreciative.
99) KENNY
[pickup3] Yeah, this place is sure a step up from that shithole motor inn.
100) LEE
[pickup3] They seem like good people. If we play our cards right, I still think it could work out for us here.
101) KENNY
[pickup3] Don't wait too long to help scope out that bandit camp. It'd be a good opportunity to find a bit more out about the St. John's and their relationship with those... bandits or whatever.
102) LEE
[pickup3] Right. I'll see what I can find out.
103) LEE
[pickup3] Good idea.
104) KENNY
[pickup3] Don't wait too long to help scope out that bandit camp.  Sounds like they're pretty amped up about it. This might be a good way to earn their trust.
105) KENNY
[pickup3]So as long as you're on THIS side, things are all right.  Provided the fence holds out.

[pickup2] I really do appreciate you asking. It's just...
12) LEE
[pickup2]It seemed like you and Mark were getting pretty close, huh?
13) LEE

14) LILLY
[pickup2] Mark is... or was... a decent guy. It's just hard losing anybody in the group, you know? Like I keep hoping we're all going to somehow come out of this together.
15) LARRY

23) LEE
[pickup2]{normalA}Think our little arrangement with them was a good idea?

[pickup2]{angryA}A little late to be asking that question now, don't ya think?

63) LARRY
[pickup2]{angryA}Yeah, and we don't need you pokin' your nose where it don't belong and getting us thrown out on our asses.
64) LILLY
[pickup2]{normalA}Just don't get too nosy. These kinds of people are usually pretty protective of their privacy.
65) LILLY

70) LILLY
[pickup2]{thinkingA} What makes you say that? {angrya}What exactly happened at the camp?
71) LEE
[pickup2]I mean, it really seemed like that woman was about to tell me something about this place before Danny shot her.
72) LILLY
[pickup2] {sadA} I know what you mean.
73) LILLY
[pickup2] No, I'm with Lee on this. There's something not right about this place.
74) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}No. Nothing
75) LARRY
[pickup2]You just told us you killed a woman, for Christ's sake. Yeah, I'd definitely say there's a lot going on.
76) LEE
[pickup2] So Larry, it looks like you're getting along with Brenda pretty well.
77) LARRY
[pickup2] You know, for a nice change of pace, how about you try minding your own fucking business?
78) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA}What were you and Kenny arguing about when I came back from the camp?
79) LILLY
[pickup2]{angryA}He's losing it, Lee. {thinkingA}He comes over and starts talking about searching the barn and that these people are hiding something--
80) LARRY
[pickup2]{angrya}But you told him to mind his own goddamn business, right? We are guests here, and we don't need to be overstaying our welcome more than we already are.
81) LILLY
[pickup2]{thinkingA}The way I see it, we need to just skip the dinner and get our food to go. {angryA} But I'm starting to think your {angryb}friend {angryA}over there has another agenda.
82) LEE
[pickup2]I don't know, maybe we SHOULD go have a look in that barn.
83) LARRY
[pickup2] Yeah, we don't wanna fuck this whole thing up.
84) LARRY
[pickup2] Come on now, we don't wanna be rude.
85) LILLY
[pickup2]{angrya}If you ask me, we should just get our dinner and leave.
86) LARRY
[pickup2]{sadA}Now, now, let's not be hasty.
87) 
I take it you and Kenny haven't made up.
88) 
What were you and Kenny arguing over?
89) 
I shot a woman.
90) 
Danny shot someone.
91) 
About your dad...
92) LILLY
[pickup3][casual - responsind to Lee asking to talk in private] {normalA}Okay.

[pickup3][wanting to talk to lilly privately about Larry, but he's nearby] {thinkingA}Hey, ah, {normalA}can I talk to you in private for a second?
94) LILLY
[pickup2]Yeah, well, don't expect that to change.  That's just how he is.
120) LILLY
[pickup2]Yeah, well, don't expect that to change.  That's just how he is.
95) LEE
[pickup2]It's been three months, your dad still treats me like I'm some kind of asshole.
121) LEE
[pickup2]It's been three months, your dad still treats me like I'm some kind of asshole.
96) 
So he's the asshole.
97) LEE
[pickup2]So HE'S the asshole.
98) 
Does he treat you like that too?
99) LEE
[pickup2]Does he treat you like that too?
100) 
How do you put up with him?
101) LEE
[pickup2]How do you put up with him?
102) LILLY
{angryA}All he's got left in the world is me.  {sadA}And that goes both ways.  {disgustA}So, yeah, he's probably gonna keep treating you like crap, but that's just because he still has one thing left to care about.
103) LILLY
{angryA}Look. My dad can be an ass sometimes, I know that.  {normalB}But he's not a bad guy.  He just... {sadA}He's got a lot of pain.
104) LILLY

[pickup2] [anxious] {Body-D}{NormalC}Hey.  Lee.  {ThinkingA}You know how to pick a lock, right?
139) KENNY
[pickup2] {FearA}Well.  You're... {SadB}you know... {ThinkingA}urban?
140) LEE
[pickup2] [subsequent inspections]  {Body-B}{AngryA}Pretty sturdy.
141) LEE
[pickup2][just had a breakthrough thought] {Body-B}{ThinkingA}Hm!
142) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{SurprisedA}What?
143) LEE
[pickup2]{ThinkingB}See those screws?  {HappyA}Instead of breaking the padlock, we can just take off the assembly, have a peek inside, {ThinkingA}and then replace it all again, like nothing ever happened.
144) KENNY
[pickup2]{HappyB}All right.  Sounds like you got a plan.  {ThinkingA}I'll hang around and keep an eye on that guy with the cow.
145) LEE
[pickup2]{NormalD}Andy.
146) KENNY
[pickup2]{DisgustA}Shit.  {FearB}I thought that {SurprisedA}was Danny.  {AngryA}Whatever.
147) LEE
[pickup2][subsequent inspections] [looking at the lock assembly] {Body-B}{ThinkingB}Screws holding it to the door.  {ThinkingA}If I can remove 'em, I don't even need to deal with the lock.
148) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Kenny thought he heard a noise
149) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{HappyA}Just checking out the barn here.  {HappyB}Never been to a dairy farm before.
150) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}What's behind this door, Andy?
151) ANDY
[pickup2]Just tools.  We keep it locked so the people in the woods don't try and grab 'em.  We'd be dead without our tools.
152) ANDY
[pickup2]{HappyA}Well, we're all sure glad his wife is here.  {NormalC}She's a lifesaver-- {HappyB}you got no idea.
153) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}He's a little jumpy, eh?
154) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{HappyA}Okay.  Well, don't just roam around without me or Danny.  {NormalC}The farm can be a dangerous place.
155) ANDY
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}You know, the bandits and all.  {NormalB}Sorry about your friend.
156) ANDY
[pickup2]Hey, uh...  do me a favor.  Don't fuck around with this door.  Just, you know, Mama gets nervous.
157) ANDY
[pickup2]{NormalC}No problem!  {HappyB}Right away, doc!
158) KATJAA
[pickup2][calling across the barn] {Body-Sit}{FearA}Andrew!  I need your help again.

163) LEE
[pickup2] {Body-B}{ThinkingA}How's the cow?
164) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{FearA}Uh... [hems a bit] {ThinkingA}when do you think, {FearA}uh, {SadA}we might eat?
165) ANDY
[pickup2][reluctant]{Body-A}{SurprisedA}Yeah.  {ThinkingA}He, uh, {HappyA}probably talks a little more than he oughta.
166) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{SadA}We met this woman up in the woods.  {ThinkingA}She seemed to know your brother.
167) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{NormalC}Yup.
168) LEE

171) LEE
[pickup2]{SadA}Uhh... {FearA}never mind.
172) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingB}Why do you lock that door?
173) ANDY
[pickup2]Cuz we can't afford to lose our shit to the people In the woods.  They come down here every once in a while, raid our stuff.  Even with the fence.
174) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{NormalC}All righty, then.
175) ANDY
[pickup2]  {Body-A}{HappyA}No problem.
176) LEE
[pickup2]It's a small tool box.
177) LEE
[pickup2]Brenda must use this thing for household repairs.
178) LEE
[pickup2]I wonder if they keep a screwdriver in there.
179) LEE
[pickup2]Multi-tool.  That should be handy.

182) ANDY
[pickup_2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Did he say what?
183) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Danny mentioned he needed something.
184) LEE
[pickup_2]{FearA}Shit, I can't remember now.  Sorry.
185) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Danny needs something again.
186) ANDY
[pickup_2][huge sigh]{Body-A}{HappyA}...  All right, all right.  {NormalB}Be right back, doc.
187) LEE
[pickup_2]{NormalB}Naw, {NormalA}not that important.
188) ANDY

189) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}So... {HappyA}Where do you keep the rest of the tools?
190) LEE

[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingB}Why was there so much blood in there?
206) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Look.  {SurpriseA}I just came in and found the door open like that.
207) ANDY
[pickup_2] {Body-A}{ThinkingA}Look.  We have food here, but {HappyB}Danny and I still gotta do a lot of hunting to keep everyone fed.  {NormalA}When we catch something in the woods, we skin it and dress it back there.  {ThinkingA}Mama doesn't like us to make a mess in the house.  {NormalB}So you see?  {HappyA}Nothin' to worry about.
208) LEE
[pickup_2]{ThinkingA}No. She went in the house.
209) ANDY

[pickup2] [To Himself] Probably hasn't been played with in months. Kinda creepy all by itself.
48) LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}"Free Tours?" I doubt these people give anything away for free now.
49) LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}You can definitely tell they built this thing themselves.
50) LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Doesn't look very safe, but I guess that's the point.
51) LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Wonder how much food they've got in there. {ThinkingA}Hopefully we'll find out.
52) LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] Brenda's been cooking a long time.
53) LEE
[pickup2] [To Himself] {DisgustA}Quaint. Doesn't offer much in the way of protection, though.
54) LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingA}They're storing gasoline all over the property.
55) LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingA}Gas keeps the generators going and the generators keep the fence going.
56) LEE
[pickup2] I don't know about these folks. Better have a look around once we're inside.
57) ANDY
[pickup2] Ya'll can see how we've kept this place so safe.
58) MARK
[pickup2] The fence keeps them out?
59) DANNY
[pickup2] You betcha. They fry like bugs in a zapper.
517) ANDY
[pickup3] You betcha. They fry like bugs in a zapper.
60) ANDY
[pickup3] We're pushing 4000 volts through that thing, with generators and amps.
61) CARLEY
[pickup2] I'm going to assume that's a lot...
62) 
Ever have any accidents?
66) LEE
[pickup2] Ever have any accidents?
63) 
This is a brilliant set up.
64) 
We can't have the kids around the fence.
65) DANNY
[pickup2] Nothing accidental yet.
67) ANDY
[pickup2] [happy as a clam] Suits us just fine.
278) ANDY
[pickup2] [happy as a clam] Suits us just fine.
68) LEE
[pickup2] [impressed] This is a really brilliant set up.
69) LEE
[pickup2] We've got kids in our group, doesn't seem safe to have them near a lethal fence.
70) DANNY
[pickup2] Uh, what Andy means is we got plenty to keep them entertained AWAY from any danger.
71) ANDY
[pickup2] Your kids got ears, right? Make sure they use 'em.
72) DANNY
[pickup2] And we're going to assume, that your friend here, uh, Lee here, is silently impressed.
279) ANDY
[pickup2] And we're going to assume, that your friend here, uh, Lee here, is silently impressed.
73) CARLEY
[pickup2][impressed] I'd say so.
74) ANDY
[pickup3] It's worth protecting, hence all the juice.
280) ANDY
[pickup2] It's worth protecting, hence all the juice.
75) BRENDA
[pickup2] I thought I saw ya'll with company comin' down the drive!
76) ANDY
[pickup2] Guys, this is our mama.
77) BRENDA
[pickup2] I'm Brenda St. John and welcome to the St. John Dairy!
78) 
We brought gasoline.
79) 
We're awful hungry.
85) LEE
[pickup2] We're awful hungry.
80) BRENDA
[pickup2] Well, you've come to the right place! And you brought the gift of gas! That will getcha somethin' to eat!
81) LEE
[pickup2] We've got a whole crew at a motel, near central Macon.
82) CARLEY
[pickup2] [kinda blurted out] We're all incredibly hungry.
83) CARLEY
[pickup2][nerve wracked] You guys have food? We're so hungry.
128) DOUG
[pickup2][nerve wracked] You guys have food? We're so hungry.
84) LEE
[pickup2] Thanks for having us. We brought some gasoline on good faith.
86) BRENDA
[pickup2] These are for ya'll. Baked fresh this morning.
87) BRENDA
[pickup2] Andy, be a darlin' and take that gas back to generator four, near the kitchen. She's low.
88) DANNY
[pickup2] [proud]Can't get stuff like that anymore, not without a cow for milk and butter, that's for sure.
89) CARLEY
[pickup2] Amazing!
90) BRENDA
[pickup2] That's right. Hopefully Maybelle will make it through this bout of whatever she's got and be with us for a good-long while.
91) BRENDA
[pickup2][quiet, talking in a background convo]  I'm not so sure, it's not like last time, and back then we had help.
92) MARK
[pickup2] [outburst] We have a vet! We could bring her here! We can help you folks out.
446) MARK
[pickup2] [outburst] We have a vet! We could bring her here! We can help you folks out.
93) BRENDA
[pickup2][quiet, talking in a background convo] You're right, I just get so--
94) DANNY
[pickup2] [quiet, talking in a background convo] Don't worry, mama. She'll power through.
95) LEE
[pickup2] We have a vet in our group. She could help ya'll.
96) MARK
[pickup2][wishes it was forever] Maybe our whole GROUP could come...for the day...
97) DANNY
[pickup2] We could use some more help here. It's just us three and Maybelle...
98) BRENDA
[pickup2][excited] A vet! Oh, my! Our prayers have been answered!
99) BRENDA
[pickup2] Well how about this, ya'll go get your veterinary friend, and I prepare some dinner. A big feast for all you hungry souls.
100) BRENDA
[pickup2] What dy'all say?
101) LEE
[pickup2] Your cow is sick? What's she--
102) LEE
[pickup2] Lets go guys. We've got what we came for and we've got our group to get back to.
103) BRENDA
Oh, ya'll are leavin? Ah. Well that's just too bad, I was thinkin--
104) MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] Come on, guys! This is our chance. We help these guys out and we're OUTTA that dingy motor lodge.
105) CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle] I don't know, Mark. We just met these people.
106) CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle]It's not that cut and dry.
107) MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] BISCUITS, CARLEY. Biscuits.
108) MARK
[pickup2][outburst] Deal! We'll get our vet friend and bring the crew back here!
109) MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] She's a sweet southern lady who just gave you BISCUITS.
110) CARLEY
[pickup2][in a huddle] We let Lee decide.
111) MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle] Come on, Lee.
112) CARLEY
[pickup2] Why don't I head back with the food and round up everyone for the trip back here.
139) DOUG
[pickup2] Why don't I head back with the food and round up everyone for the trip back here.
113) BRENDA
[pickup2] Wonderful! Family dinner at seven! Til then, ya'll come and relax.
114) CARLEY
[pickup2]You sure?
115) LEE
[pickup2]Mark's right. We help them and they help us and we upgrade our living situation.
116) LEE
[pickup2] The sons might be a little strange, but what other choice we got?
117) LEE
[pickup2] We're happy to help. Dinner sounds great.
118) MARK
[pickup2] You betcha.
119) BRENDA
[pickup2] And I'll get to findin' something to put in your bellies.
120) ANDY
[pickup2] Mark and Lee, you get settled in and find me when you're ready to help me re-secure the perimeter.
121) CARLEY
[pickup2] We should hedge our bets. We don't know if these folks want to host a whole group for the duration. I'll hang back at the motor inn with the new kid and give the rest of the group directions back here to the dairy. The inn is a shit-hole, but we should keep some defenses there until we know we're really leaving.
122) CARLEY
[pickup2] Send Kenny to come relieve me after dinner, prefably with a doggie bag. And if it works out, then we'll ALL make the move.
123) LEE
[pickup2] That's a good plan, Carley. I'm sorry you're missing out.
124) DOUG
[pickup2] Oh, wow, you guys must know a thing or two about running wire.
125) DANNY
[pickup2] Had a guy who did, yeah.
126) DOUG
[pickup2] Definitely.
127) DOUG
[pickup2][blurts out] We're starved!
129) DOUG
[pickup2][blurts out] We're all starving our butts off!
130) DOUG
[pickup2][seeing fresh food for the first time]Holy moly!
131) DOUG
[pickup2] These guys are kinda weirdos, Lee. And that's coming from me.
132) LEE
[pickup2] Nah, we got some food. I don't feel good about coming here. Let's go back.
133) MARK
[pickup2]LEE! That's crazy! LOOK at this place.
134) LEE
[pickup2] Thanks, but no thanks.
135) DOUG
[pickup2][in a huddle] We should let Lee decide.
136) DOUG
[pickup2] [in a huddle]Yeah, but, you know. We can't think with our stomachs.
137) DOUG
[pickup2] [wary][in a huddle]We should think this through.
138) MARK
[pickup2][in a huddle]BISCUITS, DOUG. Biscuits. You mean to tell me YOU of ALL PEOPLE don't like BISCUITS?
140) DOUG
[pickup2] Send Kenny to come relieve me after dinner, maybe with a doggie bag? And if it works out, then we'll ALL make the move.
141) DOUG
[pickup2] How about we hedge our bets. We don't want to just LEAVE our motor inn in case it doesn't work out here, right? I'll hang back there with the new kid, work on my warning system and give the group directions back here. We should keep someone at the inn until we know we're really leaving.
142) LEE
[pickup2] That's a good plan, Doug. Thanks for taking one for the group. I'm sorry you're missing out.
143) CARLEY
[pickup2] I see why you guys were driving such a hard bargain.
144) ANDY
[pickup2] It's valuable stuff, I don't blame ya'll for wanting to hold onto it.
145) DOUG
[pickup2] You must run through a LOT of fuel.
146) BRENDA
[pickup2] Well you've come to the right place!
147) CARLEY
[pickup2] But please, we are so hungry.
148) LEE
[pickup2] We're empty handed. Your boys wanted fuel for food but we said we had to see the place ourselves.
149) CARLEY
[pickup2] Oh my goodness, thank you.
150) BRENDA
[pickup2] Ya'll should take these fresh-baked biscuits, as a sign of our good faith. Ya'll can bring a couple tanks a fuel back here as payment.
151) DANNY
[pickup2] They brought no gas.
152) BRENDA
[pickup2] That don't mean nothin'! We're St. Johns. And St. Johns help folks in need.
153) BRENDA
[pickup2] Speaking of which, Andy, why don't you go check up on her?
154) BRENDA
[pickup2] Pay no mind, darlin'!
155) CARLEY
[pickup2] But we didn't bring any fuel, like your boys asked.
156) DOUG
[pickup2] But we're all real hungry.
157) DOUG
[pickup2] But we didn't bring any fuel, like your sons wanted.
158) DOUG
[pickup2] [seeing food for the first time in days]Really?! Thank you so much!
159) BRENDA
[pickup2] Well, if you change your mind...
160) BRENDA
[pickup2]You'd be pretty valuable to an operation like this. Especially with a vet.
161) BRENDA
[pickup2] Aww my goodness, we are sorry to hear that. We could really use the help and would make it worth ya'lls while.
162) LEE
[pickup2] We better get going.
163) CARLEY
[pickup2] Bye. Take care.
165) DOUG
Bye, take care.
164) MARK
[pickup2] [under his breath, grumpy] Worth our WHILE, Lee!
166) DANNY
[pickup2]Oh, shit!
167) LEE
[pickup2][out of breath, frightened] It's Mark! They...there were people...in the woods. They shot Mark! He's dead!
168) BRENDA
[pickup2]{fearA}Oh, Lord, no...
169) ANDY
[pickup2]God dammit!
170) ANDY
[pickup2][concerned]{fearC}Lee, what's wrong?

179) LEE
[pickup2]{fearA}It's Mark... {fearB}he's.... {sadC}Mark's dead...
180) LILLY
{fearb}[pickup2]What!?
181) LEE
[pickup2]{feara}He was shot... {fearB}by someone in the woods.
182) LILLY
{angryD}[pickup2]What the hell?
183) LEE
{angrya}[pickup2]We were out there [pointing to the fenceline] {FearB}then someone started shooting at us!
184) KENNY
{surprisedA}[pickup2]Who? {angryC}What?!
185) LARRY
{angryC}[pickup2][aggressive]What kind of shit is this?
186) 
It was a fluke.
187) KENNY
{fearC}[pickup2]Jesus Christ!
188) LARRY
{angryC}[pickup2][to Lee]You sonofabitch!
189) LEE
{angrya}[pickup2]It could have happened anywhere. {thinkingA}It could have happened to us in the motor inn.
190) LEE
{fearb}[pickup2]It was just a fluke thing... {angryA}we can't stop assuming {feara}there aren't bad people out there.
191) LILLY
{angryD}[pickup2][accusatory] What the hell do you mean "a fluke!?"
192) LEE
[pickup2]{thinkingB}Some people in the woods... {sada}they shot him...
193) KENNY
[pickup2]Jesus, Lee! Say something!
215) KENNY
{fearB}[pickup2]Jesus, Lee! Say something!
194) ANDY
{fearB}[pickup2]They gave us a lot of problems in the beginning, {fearA}killed a bunch of our farmhands. {fearB}We were able to get 'em to stop by makin' a deal.
195) ANDY
{normalB}[pickup2]Look, there's a bunch of folks out in the woods. {thinkingA}Marauders, bandits, {fearA}whatever you wanna call 'em. They're camping out back there.
196) KENNY
[pickup2]You KNEW about these people?
481) KENNY
[pickup2]You KNEW about these people?
197) ANDY
[pickup2]We're sorry! We've never had them screw with us like this! Not since we started givin' 'em food!
198) LEE
{angryb}[pickup2]You should have told us about these people!
199) LEE
[pickup2]Well, they're hassling you now!
200) ANDY
[pickup2]Those shitheads broke the arrangement!
201) LEE
{angryA}[pickup2]So much for your "deal."
202) DANNY
[pickup2]Ain't no way we're gonna let those sons o' bitches get away with this!
203) ANDY
{fearA}[pickup2]Listen, we may have had an agreement with those people, {angrya}but we will {angryB}NOT stand {angryA}for this shit.
204) DANNY
{fearA}[pickup2]Mama knows what she's doin'. {happya}She's done this plenty of times.
205) ANDY
{happyA}[pickup2]Take it easy.
206) LEE
{fearA}[pickup2]It's Mark... {sada}he's hurt.
207) LILLY
{angryB}[pickup2]We need to see him! {angryA}What the hell happened?
208) LEE
{fearB}[pickup2]I don't know. He said he was fine. {fearA}Brenda took him inside.
209) LILLY
{fearB}[pickup2]Christ... Is he gonna be okay?
210) LEE
{fearA}[pickup2][ignoring Larry] There are people out there in the woods. {fearb}We were out there [points at fence], and they almost killed us both.
211) LEE
{fearA}[pickup2]He got shot with an arrow.

289) LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingA}What's going on with them?

[pickup2] {ThinkingA}Dunno. Squabblin', looks like. A lotta tension with ya'll, huh?
292) BRENDA
[pickup2] {HappyB}We all get a little testy. We'll fix that shortly!

[pickup2]{AngryA}Ow!  Dammit!  {FearA}That thing is moving fast...
309) LEE
[pickup2]Ehn![or other effort noise] {DisgustA}That thing is on there too tight for my bare hands.
310) LEE
[pickup2] {ThinkingA}There.  That should do it.
311) LEE
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}There ya go.
312) LEE
[pickup2]Yep, that thing is busted.
313) LEE
[pickup2][smiles]{HappyB}They look happy.
314) LEE
[pickup2]Huh.  The other board had holes in it.  This one isn't quite gonna work.
315) DUCK
[pickup2]I'mma flip you over the top branch!  Get ready for super crazy jet mode!
316) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Thanks, Lee!
317) DUCK
[pickup2]Yeah!  Can I help?
318) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Higher, Duck!  Higher!
319) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Awesome!
320) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Cool!
321) LEE
[pickup2]Okay, then.  Give it a try.
322) LEE
[pickup2][Lee is imagining the worst, i.e. Duck nailing his own hand to a board.] Eh, not just right now, kiddo.
323) LEE
[pickup2]Hey guys.  I think I got something that'll fix the swing.
324) LEE
[pickup_2]Nice plank of wood.  Got a knot in it, but other than that...
325) LEE
[pickup2][effort]  {AngryA}Unh!
326) LEE
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}That oughta do it.
327) LEE
[pickup2] The seat needs holes in it, for the ropes to pass through.  How the hell am I gonna make a hole in this thing?
328) LEE
[pickup2] {HappyA}Heh.  That was fun.
329) LEE
[pickup2]What is that?
330) LEE
[pickup2]Are those glasses?
331) LEE
[pickup2] Sure are a lot of spiders under here.   Eesh.
332) LEE
[pickup2]An old pair of glasses.  Strange.
333) LEE
[pickup2][effort noise, reaching]Uh!  C'mere, you little....
334) LEE
[pickup2]Gotcha!
335) LEE
[pickup2]I don't like this...
336) LEE
[pickup2]And there's... maybe blood?  Cracked lenses?  How the hell did they get under the gazebo?
337) LEE
[pickup2]Not Brenda's style.  These look like something an old woman would wear.
338) LEE
[pickup2] I don't wear prescriptions.
339) LEE
[pickup2]I got 20/20 vision.
340) LEE
[pickup2]Maybe if I see some ants that need burning.
341) LEE
[pickup2]Not really my style.
342) LEE
[pickup2]Maybe Grandma Everett might wear these-- but not me.
343) LEE
[pickup2]There may yet come a day when I need to impersonate a near-sighted 70 year old woman... but that day is not this day.
344) LEE
[pickup2]If there is anything in all of creation that could reduce my chances of getting laid MORE than a worldwide zombie apocalypse... it is these glasses.
345) LEE
[pickup2]It's a small tool box.
346) LEE
[pickup2]Brenda must use this thing for household repairs.
347) LEE
[pickup2]I wonder if they keep a screwdriver in there.
348) LEE
[pickup2]Multi-tool.  That should be handy.
349) LEE
[pickup_2]Just gonna borrow this for a second.

So much for your "understanding."
381) LEE
[out of breath, frightened]{sadC} ... He's dead!
382) LILLY
[pickup3]Christ!  Are you gonna be okay?
383) BRENDA
[Pickup3]{HappyA}And thank your friend Katjaa again for me.  She and the kids are in the barn with the cow.  That woman is a life saver!
384) 
Danny y Andy
385) 
[pickup3] [trying to calm everyone down after Mark was hurt or killed at the fence]No sabemos EXACTAMENTE dónde está esa gente en el bosque, pero Danny descubrió que al menos UNO de sus campos… es una mierda.
386) 
[pickup3] [trying to calm everyone down after Mark was hurt or killed at the fence]Escuchen todos. Les PROMETO que esta lechería estará a salvo.
387) 
[pickup3]Será mejor que vaya contigo. Quiero ver con quién estamos lidiando.
388) 
[pickup3]¿Y qué tal si voy y tengo una pequeña conversación con ellos?
389) DANNY
[pickup3][follows 310497904]When you're ready to go scope out that bandit camp, come find us.
390) ANDY
[pickup3][nervous that Lee is messing with the generator] {FearA}Hey, uh, don't mess with that okay?  {ThinkingA}The things a litle tricky and I don't wanna spend half a day trying to fix it again.
393) MARK
I could see myself staying here for a long time.
394) LEE
You want to leave the motel?
395) MARK
The motel's not going to hold up much longer.
396) MARK
So what do you think, Lee? Should we stick around here?
397) MARK
[pickup3][standing in pain - medium]
398) MARK
[pickup3][standing in pain - medium]
399) MARK
[pickup3][alt- in pain from an arrow wound, but trying to be a man about it]Yeah... I'll be all right once it's out, but, goddamn it hurts!
400) LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny Arguing.  follows #310498201] {ThinkingA}They don't exactly see eye to eye on how we should be doing things.
401) LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny's arguing] {HappyA}Each of them want to be in charge, you know?
402) LEE
[pickup3][explaining Lilly & Kenny fighting]{ThinkingA}They have different ideas about how we should run our group.  If they don't find any common ground, this whole thing's gonna fall apart.
403) KENNY
[pickup3]All right, Duck, let's let Clementine have a try for a bit.
404) KENNY
[pickup3]All right, Duck, time to take a break.
405) 
[pickup3][neutral greeting]¿Qué pasa, Lee?
406) KENNY
[pickup3][Duck reallly want to get back on the swing]Okay, Duck, don't pop a gasket.
407) 
[pickup3]Bien, Duck, ¿listo para otro turno?
408) 
[pickup3][ambient]No tan alto.
409) 
[pickup3][ambient]Ten cuidado .
410) 
[pickup3][ambient]Patea más fuerte.
411) 
[pickup3][ambient]Qué bonito aire.
412) 
[pickup3][ambient]A ver si logras llegar hasta arriba.
413) 
[pickup3][commenting on the repaired swing]Buen trabajo, Lee.
414) 
Does that offer apply to the rest of us?
444) LEE
[pickup3]Does that offer apply to the rest of us?
415) DANNY
[pickup3][normal] Had a guy who did, yeah.
416) ANDY
[pickup3]Oh, don't worry about that.  We've got plenty to keep 'em entertained.
417) DOUG
[pickup3][seeing the dairy for the first time]Oh, wow!  You've got enough electricity to run the whole place!
418) CARLEY
[pickup3][seeing the dairy for the first time]This place looks untouched!  You'd never know the rest of the world is in ruins.
419) ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He's from Macon.
420) BRENDA
[pickup3]A couple of our old farm hands were from Macon. They grow 'em good there.
421) ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He been living down at that old Motel round the way.
422) BRENDA
[pickup3]Oh my goodness, that place is pretty vulnerable.  Have you got someone with survival experience to lead your group?
423) ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He moves around a lot, but with things the way they are, maybe we can convince him to stick around for a while.
424) ANDY
[pickup3]This here's Lee.  He's ah... ya never did say where you were from.
425) LEE
[pickup3]You were right.  I'm a local boy.
426) DANNY
[pickup3][normal]They've got a few more friends staying at the old motel.
427) 
We work together.
428) 
Lilly keeps us focused on survival..
429) 
Kenny's working on getting us somewhere safer.
430) 
I've got things under control.
431) LEE
[pickup3] I've got things under control over there.
432) BRENDA
[pickup3] Sounds like a smart man.
433) LEE
[pickup3]Kenny's working on getting us somewhere safer... He doesn't think the motor inn will stay safe forever.
434) LEE
[pickup3]Lilly.  She's tough as nails and keeps us focused on what it takes to survive.
435) LEE
[pickup3]We all work together.  Plus, we've got plenty of people with military experience.
436) BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, I hope you know what you're doing.  That place isn't safe like it is here.
437) MARK
[pickup3]Lilly was in the military, like me.
438) BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, that's good to hear.  That motel ain't the safest place.
439) BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, thats good to hear.  That motel ain't the safest place.
440) ANDY
[pickup3][catching Lee in a lie] Hold on.  I thought you said someone else was running things?
441) LEE
[pickup3][caught in a lie]Oh, yeah, I thought she was asking about survival tactics...
442) BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, it don't matter.  You're here now.  We'll make sure you're safe and comfortable.
443) BRENDA
[pickup3]Now that y'all are here, we'll make sure you're safe and comfortable.
445) DOUG
[pickup3][stuffing buscutis into his mouth]Sorry.
447) BRENDA
[pickup3]It'll be nice to have some folks to help out around here again. Danny, why don't you come help me out in the kitchen.
448) DOUG
[pickup3]No problem.  Ben can come with me.
449) ANDY
[pickup3]You might wanna take someone with you. Remember, those roads can be dangerous.
450) MARK
[pickup3]Take this.
451) BEN
[pickup3]Thanks.
452) MARK
[pickup3]Why don't you go ahead and take Ben along anyway.
453) CARLEY
[pickup3]I can handle myself.
454) CARLEY
[pickup3][heartfelt] Take care of yourself, Lee.  See ya in a while.
455) DOUG
[pickup3]All right!  See ya later!
456) ANDY
[pickup3] Mark, Lee, why don't ya take a look around.  Once ya get settled in, I could use some help securin' the perimeter.
457) ANDY
[pickup3]Sometimes, the dead get tangled up in the fence before they fry and end up knocking over a post.  It'd be a big help if you two could walk the perimeter.
458) LEE
[pickup3]Is there a problem? [with the fence?]
459) MARK
[pickup3]  [slightly hushed] This place is INCREDIBLE!!  It's got food!  And that fence... oh man that fence!! If we play our cards right, this might turn out to be a place we can stay. So how do you want to play this?
460) 
We should do whatever we can to help out!
461) 
Let's make sure the place is safe.
462) LEE
[pickup3]Before we can think about bringing our whole group here to stay, we need to figure out if this place is as safe as they say.
463) LEE
[pickup3] They are offering us food, we should do whatever we can to make these people like us!
464) MARK
[pickup3]Right.  Obviously THEY think it's safe, but is it safe enough for the kids?  I noticed a broken swing over there.  Not a big deal, but maybe there's other things not working that we just can't see yet.
465) LEE
[pickup3]And checking the fence perimeter sounds like a decent way to get a good look at their defences.
466) LEE
[pickup3]All the more reason for us to NOT fuck this up.  If Andy needs some help securing the perimeter, then that's what we do.
467) 
[pickup3]También noté un columpio roto por allá. Arreglarlo podría valernos unos puntos de brownie. Además, ¡estoy seguro de que Duck y Clem les encantaría!
468) 
[pickup3]Muy bien. ¡Seamos invitados modelo!
469) MARK
[pickup3]The way Brenda was talking, I get the feeling like she'd be happy to have us stay.
470) MARK
[pickup3]All right, I'll keep my eyes open and you find out what you can from Andy.
471) 
The electric fence came on!
472) LEE
[pickup3]The electric fence came on!  Some people started attacking from the woods and we got trapped between them and the fence!
473) ANDY
[pickup3][flustered]I... I heard Mark yell and thought y'all were giving me the all clear! [sincere]Man, I am real sorry.
474) ANDY
[pickup3][suprised and concerned] Bandits!? Here?!  On our property?!
475) LEE
[pickup3][having been attacked by Bandits] I thought this place was safe!
476) ANDY
[pickup3]Fucking bandits!  They have no right being out here on our property!
477) DANNY
[pickup3][looking at the arrow in Marks shoulder]Holy shit!  Are you okay?
478) LARRY
[pickup2][incredulous] With an arrow!?
479) KATJAA
[pickup3][seeing an arrow in Marks shoulder] Mark!  Oh my god, what happened?!
480) MARK
[pickup3][in pain from the arrow, but manning up]Yeah, I'm fine.  I should just... pull it out...
482) LEE
[pickup3][calming down after the attack]We ran into some people on the way up here... bandits I guess.  I think it was them that attacked us.
483) DANNY
[pickup3][normal]Food for protection. {fearA} Not like we had much of a choice, but they did stop hasslin' us.
484) 
It isn't as safe here as we thought.
485) LEE
[pickup3]Maybe it isn't as safe here as we thought.
486) ANDY
[pickup3]Hey kids, look what Lee got working for ya!
487) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]A swing!!  I love swings!  Just like at my treehouse!  Come on, Duck!
488) ANDY
[pickup3][commending Lee for fixing the swing for the kids]You're a good guy, Lee.  Nice Job.
489) ANDY
[pickup3]No wonder you're the leader of your group!
490) ANDY
[pickup3]Hey, I remembered seeing kids in your group, so I went ahead and fixed that swing while you were out.  Hope you kids like swings!
491) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][stops to thank lee before running off to play]Thanks Lee!  You're the best!
492) ANDY
[pickup3]Anytime.  We're looking out for ya!
493) LEE
[pickup3][for fixing the swing for the kids]Thanks.
494) KENNY
[pickup4]What we need to do is find a way to get our whole group out here to stay.  Take this place over if we have to.
495) LARRY
[pickup3]Cool your jets there, Rambo.  These are nice people. Let's not do anything to get us thrown out before we eat!
496) KENNY
[pickup4]Not safe?!  This place is a hell of a lot safer than that motor inn!  I think all of us and our guns can handle a couple of punks with bows and arrows!
497) LILLY
[pickup3][voicing her opinion but trying to keep it out of earshot]Bandits?  Are you serious?  This place isn't safe, we can't stay here.
498) LEE
[pickup3]I'm gonna head out with Dan to find out more about these bandits.  Getting him off the property for a while should give you a chance to check out this place a little deeper.  See if there's a way to get them to let us stay for a while.
499) LEE
[pickup3]Listen, Mark and I were scoping out the place before the bandits showed up.  Other than that, this place does seem pretty secure.
500) LEE
[pickup3]I think getting on these people's good side is gonna be important.  They've already said they have plenty of food. If we can get them thinking that having us here will benefit them, then we all win.
501) LARRY
[pickup3]We'll bring 'em a doggy bag or something.
502) LEE
[pickup3]Where's Ben and Doug?
503) LILLY
[pickup3]Since Doug ATE  half the biscuits on the way to get us, I had them stay back.  I still don't think we should be trying to stay here and someone's gotta watch the motor inn until we get back.
504) LILLY
[pickup3]Since Carley and Ben ate some of the food on the way back to get us, she volunteered to stay behind and watch the motor inn until we get back.
505) LEE
[pickup3]Where's Ben and Carley?
506) LILLY
[pickup3][disgusted] Yeah, that's... real charming, dad.
507) LEE
I'm gonna head out and help Dan deal with these bandits.  You guys should try to make friends with Andy and Brenda while Im gone.
508) LARRY
[pickup3]Well that's easy.  I've got charm coming outta my ass.
509) LILLY
[pickup3]They'll be fine.  We need to focus on what we are doing HERE.
510) 
Vayamos a revisar el lugar.
511) 
Hay que caerles bien.
512) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Looks like the fence runs around the entire property, not just the house.
513) ANDY
[pickup3] {NormalA}Yep. Can't take any chances when it comes to safety.
514) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}The fence is fantasic.  We'll do whatever you want to help keep it running.
515) ANDY
[pickup3]{HappyA}Well, clearing that perimeter is gonna be a big help.  Just let me know when you're ready.
516) LEE
[pickup3][to himself]{ThinkingB}I guess Mark and I were lucky we weren't touching this thing when it came on.
518) LEE
[pickup3] {ThinkingB}Make it safe for Clem and Duck, and let the St. John's know we can pull our weight around here.
519) LEE
[pickup3][to himself looking at the broken swing] {ThinkingA}Looks like it just needs a new board for the seat and some rope.
520) LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{SadA}Too bad it's broken. {ThinkingA}I'll bet Clementine and Duck would have loved something like this to play on.
521) ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{NormalA}Kids used to like that old swing even more than the tour sometimes!
522) LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyA}I'll bet.
523) 
Mind if I try to fix it?
524) 
How long since it's been used?
525) 
How did it break?
526) ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyB}Sure!  That'd be great!  Momma sure does appreciate you all helping out.
527) LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{HappyA}Mind if I fix it?
528) ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard] {HappyC}Amen to that.
529) LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard] {HappyA}I look forward to a day when kids can just be kids again.
530) ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}Been quite awhile. Don't exactly have a lot of kids visiting anymore.
531) LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{DisgustA}When was the last time it got any use?
532) LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}How'd it break?
533) ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{SadA}Got busted the first day those... things showed up.  Thank God no one was on it at the time.
534) ANDY
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{ThinkingA}Looking for a place to relax before dealing with the outer fence?
535) LEE
[pickup3][Calling out from across the yard]{DisgustA}Nah. Just looking around.
536) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}I've got some rope that should work...
537) LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}I'm gonna need some rope.
538) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}...And there's got to be a board around here I can use as a seat.
539) LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}...But that board I found is too long.
540) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}...And I've cut the board down to the right size.
541) LEE
[pickup3][looking in the storage bench]{ThinkingA}This rope is perfect for the swing.
542) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Everything in here looks safe.  {ThinkingB}And now I know where to find some rope in case they need help tying anything down.
543) LEE
[pickup3][looking in the storage bench]{DisgustA}Nothing else I need in here.
544) LEE
[pickup3][looking at the fixed swing]{HappyA}All fixed.  That should make everyone happy!
545) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This board is good, but I need some rope.
546) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This rope will work great as soon as I find a board the right length.
547) LEE
[pickup3][getting ready to fix he swing] All right, this shouldn't be too tough.
548) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}I'll bet they go through a lot of wood keeping those fences repaired.
549) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}This is too big right now, but if I can find something to cut it down to size, this might make a good seat for the swing.
550) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Mind if I use one of these boards?
551) ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Already making some repairs, huh?  I like a guy who takes some initiative!  {HappyA}Yeah, go right ahead!
552) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}If a couple of tools out in the open is unsafe as it gets, we'll be fine here.
553) LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}Would have been nice to have one of these back at the motor inn.
554) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Could be useful if I find some boards to cut.
555) LEE
[pickup3][taking the saw in anticipation of cutting some boards.]  {ThinkingB}Hmm...
556) BRENDA
[pickup3]You know, I used to push Andy and his brother out here on that swing every night when they were kids. [sighs] Seems like such a long time ago now.
557) BRENDA
[pickup3]Did you say something darlin'?  [Then notices the repaired swing - Happy!] Oh my goodness. Did you do that?
558) LEE
[pickup3]Just trying to help out a bit around here.
559) LEE
[pickup3][calling out across the yard] Hopefully our kids will like it too.
560) LEE
[pickup3]Yeah...it does.
561) 
[pickup3][calling out across the yard]Buen trabajo, Lee. Las cosas comienzan a sentirse otra vez como solían ser.
562) ANDY
[pickup3][seeing that Lee fixed the swing - To himself]Well I'll be damned.
563) ANDY
[pickup3][calling out across the yard]Momma's gonna be thrilled to see that old swing all fixed up.
564) ANDY
[pickup3][genuinely curious as to what Lee is working on.  NOT suspicious.]{SurprisedA}Hey... {DisgustA}What are ya fixing to do around the barn?
565) ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Ah, there'll be plenty of time for all that stuff later, after we go fix up the fence on the outer perimiter.
581) ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Ah, there'll be plenty of time for all that stuff later, after we go fix up the fence on the outer perimiter.
566) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Just trying to find more ways to help out!
567) ANDY
[pickup3]{HappyA}Well, I appreciate that!
568) ANDY
[pickup3]Tell ya what, {HappyB}We'll find ya something to do over there after we get back from securing the perimeter.
569) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
576) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
578) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
580) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyB}Sounds good.
570) LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}How secure is your barn?  Having a safe place for the cow is pretty important.
571) ANDY
[pickup3]{NormalA}Thanks to the fence, nothing gets in here anymore.  {SadA}Unfortunately the deadies took most of our cattle before we got it running.
572) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Mind if I take a look?
579) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Mind if I take a look?
573) ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Sure, but why don't we do that after we tend to the perimeter?
577) ANDY
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Sure, but why don't we do that after we tend to the perimeter?
574) LEE
[pickup3][responding to"What are ya fixing to do at the barn?"]{ThinkingA}Nothing.
575) ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]{ThinkingA}Just giving yourself the tour, huh?
582) 
Just trying to help out.
583) 
I'm curious about your barn.
584) 
Nothing.
585) LEE
[pickup3][to himself - looking at the ribbons]{ThinkingA}These people put a lot of love into this dairy.
586) ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{SadA}This place was my daddy's life.  It meant everything to him.
587) LEE
[pickup3][calling across the yard]{ThinkingA}This dairy won a lot of ribbons in its day, huh?
588) ANDY
[pickup3]{DisgustA}Then one day the world changed...Now this place is all we have left of Daddy.  {ThinkingA}That's why we take such good care if it, and why we want to share it with good folks like yourselves.
589) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Is that right?
590) LEE
[pickup3]{NormalA}My folks stopped after two as well.
591) ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{HappyA}You know, when he first bought this place, this was a single story house.
592) ANDY
[pickup3][heartfelt]{ThinkingA}After us kids were born, he insisted on adding a second floor.  Said they had to have room for as many babies as they could have. [with a smile]{SadA}...Momma was done after Dan.
593) LEE
[pickup3][taking in a deep sniff] {HappyA}Mmmm, fresh herbs!  I can hardly wait for dinner!
594) 
[pickup3][playing on the swing]¡Empújame más alto!
595) 
[pickup3][playing on the swing]¡Síiiiiii!
596) 
[pickup3][playing on the swing]¡Qué divertido!
597) 
[pickup3][playing on the swing]¡Yo también tengo un columpio en mi casa!
598) 
[pickup3][Responding to mark asking"how do we play this"]Lo tocaremos de oído.
599) BRENDA
[pickup3]Well, you must be the veterinarian in the group!  Why don't you help me get your friend patched up, then we can talk about our poor cow.
600) BRENDA
[pickup3]I've been fixing wounds around here for years. I've got enough gauze and needles to last a lifetime!
601) KATJAA
[pickup3]Well, if you need help, I can keep the wound clean while you apply the stitches.
602) KATJAA
[pickup3][concerned about Mark's wound]Do you have any antibiotics or anything to stop infection?
603) DANNY
[pickup3][folows  310497904] They're hard to pin down, but I think I know where at least ONE of their camps are.
604) LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I hope Mark is okay in there.
605) LEE
[pickup3]{DisgustA}If there's not enough room in the house for all of us, I guess a few of us could camp out in here in shifts.
606) 
[pickup3][joking around/flirting]Bueno, ya veremos eso.
607) 
[pickup3][process in the distance][joking around/flirting]Larry, pórtate bien o no te dejaré tocarme en toda la noche!
608) 
[pickup3][process in the distance][joking around]…¡No había comido un bombón así desde que estaba en servicio!
609) LEE
[pickup3][looking at gas cans][follows 310497452]{ThinkingB}We'll just have to make sure the kids don't get into it.
610) LEE
[pickup3][follows 310497311]{ThinkingA}We're gonna need to learn how to maintain it if we end up staying here.
611) LEE
[pickup3][looking at bales of hay] {ThinkingA}Enough of these might work as adequate cover from arrows if that becomes a problem.
612) 
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]Sé a qué te refieres. Mi chica es lo que me hace seguir. Si no fuera por ella, no sé si me molestaría en luchar con lo que el mundo se ha convertido.
613) 
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]No digas eso, todos estamos buscando algo mejor. ¡Al menos tenemos salud!
614) BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient]Oh I manage just fine.  Plus I have my boys to help out.  I couldn't do it without them.
615) LARRY
[pickup3][ambient]So how does a woman like you self run this whole place?
616) BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient][Laughs.]
647) LARRY
[pickup3][ambient][Laughs]
660) BRENDA
[pickup3][ambient][Laughs.]
661) LARRY
[pickup3][ambient][Laughs]
617) LARRY
[pickup3][ambient][process muted or positional]ah, ya better tell that to my ticker.
618) MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}So what have ya found out?  Is this looking like a good place to stay?
619) LEE
[pickup3]{NormalA}I'll keep looking around.
620) LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I didn't get a chance to check out the barn area yet.  {NormalA}I'll do that after after helping Andy get the perimeter secured.
621) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}The fence is no joke, at least around the house.  I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of it.
622) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}The generator might be a problem.  Andy said it's "tricky" and repairing it takes him a while.
623) 
I can't check the barn yet.
624) 
That fence is no joke!
625) 
The Generators might be a problem...
626) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Still, it's a hell of a lot more secure than the motor inn.
627) MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingB}All right.  Keep me posted.
628) MARK
[pickup3]{ThinkingB}So what's your read on Andy so far?  Think they'd be open to letting us stay?
629) MARK
[pickup3]{HappyA}I knew that'd be a good idea!
630) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}He and Brenda both seemed real happy to have that swing fixed.
631) 
Se alegraron de que arreglaran el columpio.
632) 
Securing the perimeter will help a lot!
633) MARK
[pickup3]{HappyA}We'll be getting in good AND making this place safer for us!
634) LEE
[pickup3]{ThinkingA}Getting the perimeter secured is gonna help us a lot.
635) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}I'm gonna get back to it.
636) LEE
[pickup3][to himself - looking at the generatior]{FearA}I'm glad Andy knows how to fix this if something goes wrong.  {ThinkingA}I'm clueless about this stuff.
637) MARK
[pickup3]{SadA}Dammit.
638) LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I may have pushed too hard asking Brenda about her house...
639) 
Puede que haya ofendido a Brenda…
640) 
Andy seems open to guests.
641) LEE
[pickup3]{HappyA}Andy tells me they've had guests stay here before.  That tells me they are open to the idea.
642) MARK
[pickup3]{HappyB}Thats fantastic!
643) 
Andy might think we're dangerous.
644) LEE
[pickup3]{FearA}I may have turned Andy off when talking up our guns.
645) MARK
[pickup3]{AngryA}Shit, well ... do something to turn him on again!
646) MARK
[pickup3]{SadA}You know what I mean.
648) LARRY
[pickup3][reluctantly leaving Brenda as lee approaches]{normalB}We'll, uh... We'll finish talking later.

Little help here, Lee?

C'mon, Lee, we don't have all day.

Damnit, Lee, I can't lift it myself.

Hehe, I got you!
7) BANDIT

10) BANDIT
There ya are!

Don't think I can't see you!
13) BANDIT
I'll fuck you sumbitches up!
14) BANDIT
I see ya!
15) MARK
What do you think of this place, Lee?
16) LEE
It's a nice change from the motel.
17) MARK
You said it. Out here, it's almost like things used to be.
18) LEE
I don't plan on staying.
19) MARK
I could see myself staying here for a long time.
129) MARK
I could see myself staying here for a long time.
131) MARK
I could see myself staying here for a long time.
20) LEE
Still too early to tell.
21) LEE
Except for the zombies and bandits.
22) LEE
It'll never be like it used to be.
23) MARK
Yeah, these guys have lost as much as any of us.
24) MARK
The motel's not going to hold up much longer.
25) LEE
You want to leave the motel?
26) MARK
These folks need us, Lee. We could work something out.
27) LEE
We haven't been invited to stay.
28) MARK
[good-natured] Bastard.
29) LEE
We don't know these people.
30) LEE
[teasing] Who says that worked out?
31) MARK
You didn't know ME before you showed up at the base.
32) MARK
Keep telling that to everybody trying to kill us. Maybe they'll go away.
33) LEE
It's safer back at the motel.
34) MARK
With the fence working, this place is like a fortress.
35) MARK
Not many drivers these days, Lee.
36) MARK
We could scrounge up a year's worth of gas, easy.
37) LEE
The fence only lasts as long as the gas does.
38) MARK
We've got enough people.
39) LEE
A fortress needs people to defend it.
281) 
A fortress needs people to defend it.
40) MARK
You're too paranoid, Lee.
41) LEE
Don't get too comfortable here.
42) LEE
What about 'em?
43) LEE
This place is going to fall apart, just like everywhere else.
44) LEE
These folks are just delaying the inevitable.
45) MARK
Well, let's help 'em delay it a bit longer.
46) MARK
Sheesh, Lee. You sound like Kenny.
47) LEE
We've got enough people to take this place by force, if we have to.
48) BANDIT
Come on out!
49) BANDIT
It ain't right, we had a deal!
50) BANDIT
You fucked with us, now we'll take what we want.
51) BANDIT
Show Yourself!!
52) MARK
This one must've knocked it over trying to get through.
53) MARK
Andy said, when this fence is working, the walkers go up like a tree branch on a power line.
54) MARK
He's tangled up in there pretty good. Come on, help me get this thing back in place so we can get Mr. Crispy off of there.
55) MARK
[exertion from lifting] Nggrrhh....
56) LEE
[panicked] What happened?!
288) 
What happened?!
57) MARK
[pickup3][in pain] Some asshole shot me! God DAMN!
58) LEE
Can you walk?
289) 
Can you walk?
59) MARK
[pickup3][in pain] Yeah...  But I ain't moving while that maniac is out there!
60) LEE
We gotta get out of here.
290) 
We gotta get out of here.
61) MARK
[pickup3][in pain] If we move, we're dead!
62) LEE
Let's get out of here!
63) MARK
[in pain] Yeah, but  we can't just walk out into the open. We need cover!
336) MARK
[in pain] Yeah, but  we can't just walk out into the open. We need cover!
64) LEE
C'mon, if we can reach the gate, we get through this fence and back to the house.
65) MARK
[pickup3][in pain] Aghh!  Shit that hurts!
66) LEE
[exertion from lifting] Nggghh...
67) MARK
[hit by arrow] Gaaaahhh!
68) MARK
[surprised, in pain] What the- ?
69) BANDIT
I told you what would happen, you son of a bitch!
70) MARK
[tense/under fire][in pain] JESUS!!! Who the fuck is that?!
71) LEE
No fuel. Of course.
72) MARK
[pickup3][In pain] Lee! We've gotta do something!
73) MARK
[responding to Lee's silence]["It's almost like things used to be..."][Sad] ...Almost.
74) MARK
[responding to Lee's silence]Well... better here than out with the... you know. [zombies]
75) MARK
If those lights are out that means the fence is off, right?
76) LEE
It'd better be.
77) MARK
There's one.
78) MARK
Eeugh.
79) LEE
Come on, let's push it off.
80) MARK
I see it.
236) LEE
[pickup2] I see it.
81) LEE
There's another one.
235) MARK
[pickup2] There's another one.
82) MARK
Ya never do get used to the smell, do ya?
359) MARK
Ya never do get used to the smell, do ya?
83) LEE
[chuckles] Nope.
358) LEE
[chuckles] Nope.
84) MARK
[continuing/responding to silence]'Cause I find it to be a breath of fresh air.  Literally!
85) MARK
So what do you think, Lee? Should we stick around here?
86) MARK
[awkwardly starting the conversation again] Sooo... what about the brothers?
87) MARK
[responding to Lee's silence]...Oookay....
88) LEE
Thanks.
255) LEE
Thanks.
89) MARK
I dunno.  They seem decent enough. I just want you to know that I've got your back if anything goes down.
90) MARK
Come on, I think I see where they're getting in.
91) MARK
[context: no need to worry about it, it's dead] Lee, it's dead.
92) MARK
[sarcastic]If you're waiting for that guy to help, it ain't gonna happen. [now get over here and help me]Come on.
93) LEE
Get down!
135) MARK
[Urgent/not shouted]Get down!
94) MARK
Fuck!  Now what?!

Yeah... barely.

Holy fuck!  What just happened?!
118) LEE
The fences are on!

[Urgent/not shouted]Lee, get back here!
136) MARK
[Urgent/not shouted]Quickly!  He'll see you!
137) LEE
[pickup1][With mark behind the tractor after its stuck on a still living zombie]Shit.  Now what?
141) MARK
[pickup1] [friendly conversation with Lee while walking the fence line][mild outdoor projection]Hey, maybe we should try to get Larry out here, huh? Let him get some fresh air in those dusty lungs...
142) MARK
[pickup1] [friendly conversation with Lee while walking the fence line][mild outdoor projection][continued]... Maybe then he'll realize you're no danger to this group.
143) MARK
[pickup1] [friendly conversation with Lee while walking the fence line][mild outdoor projection][cont.]... I think even Larry would have trouble being a "racist asshole" out here!
144) MARK
[pickup1] [friendly conversation with Lee while walking the fence line][mild outdoor projection][cont.]... Whatever his problem is with you, I bet he'd forget all about it!
145) LEE
[pickup1][explaining why the tractor stopped] Shit. It's one of the dead we pushed down earlier. I'm gonna have to move it.
146) MARK
[pickup3][in pain][behind the tractor for cover when it stops moving]What happened?
147) MARK
[pickup3][in pain][as the tractor stops again]Another one?  How many of those things did we push down?
148) MARK
[pickup1][looking at the dead zombie they just pushed off the fence]Who do you think he was?
149) LEE
[pickup1][response to Mark asking who the zombie on the fence might have been] It doesn't matter.
150) LEE
[pickup1][response to Mark asking who the zombie on the fence might have been]Maybe a farm hand.  I dunno.  I hope he wasn't like this long before the fence finished him off.
151) MARK
[pickup1][agreeing that it's better to be dead than a zombie] Yeah.
152) MARK
[pickup1][looking at the dead zombie they pushed off the fence] Poor guy.

[pickup2] I know you said this place wasn't right for us, but c'mon, LOOK at it!
181) MARK
[pickup2] I know you said we shouldn't trust strangers, but they seem all right. Besides, this place! I mean, C'MON!
182) MARK
[pickup2]Listen, I know you think this place isn't safe for Clementine, but you're being a little overprotective.
183) LEE
[pickup2]Why the hell did you have to tell him I thought he's a racist? As if tensions weren't high enough!
184) LEE
[pickup2]He wouldn't be such a pain in the ass if you weren't telling him we were talking behind his back all the time.
185) LEE
[pickup2]What were you thinking, telling him what I said about him thinking I'm dangerous?
186) MARK
[pickup2]Sorry man! It just... popped out!
187) MARK
[pickup2]I'm sorry, all right?
188) MARK
[pickup2] I mean, you DID admit it right to his face...
189) 
He's a piece of shit.
190) 
We'll work it out somehow.
193) LEE
[pickup2] We'll work it out somehow.
191) 
I try to be civil at least.
194) LEE
[pickup2] I try to be civil, at least.
192) LEE
[pickup2] That guy's a piece of shit anyway.
195) MARK
[pickup2]He's too busy being cranky to notice.
196) MARK
[pickup2]Well, hopefully he'll calm down once he's out here.
197) MARK
[pickup2] Relax. You're not making things any better riling him up.
198) MARK
[pickup2] Well, maybe a good meal will chill him out a little.
199) MARK
[pickup2]Christ, I can't stop thinking about dinner.
200) 
Focus on the task.
201) 
We'll go ask for more to eat after.
202) 
I'm hungry, too.
203) LEE
[pickup2] If they've got as much food as they say, I think so.
204) LEE
[pickup2] Just try to focus on the task.
205) MARK
[pickup2] Do you think they're gonna be good for it? Dinner for a whole group of people?
206) LEE
[pickup2] We'll go ask for more to eat after this is done.
207) MARK
[pickup2] All right, I can suck it up.
208) LEE
{pickup2} I'm hungry too, Mark.
209) MARK
[pickup2] They knew what they were doing, teasing us with food and then giving us chores!
210) LEE
[pickup2] Having a good meal will be worth it.
211) MARK
[pickup2] Let's just get this done. Maybe Brenda has some more bread in the house.
212) MARK
[pickup2] Once this fence is patched up, this place'll be a fortress! God, can you imagine not having to worry about the walkers anymore?
213) LEE
[pickup2] We've got the people to defend it.

[pickup2] Between us and the dairy guys? No problem!
215) LEE
[pickup2] We still need to be careful. It's still dangerous as hell.
216) MARK
[pickup2] We just keep the kids away from it, nothing to worry about.
217) MARK
[pickup2] True, but it's also dangerous to the walkers.
218) LEE
[pickup2] It's dangerous.
283) 
It's dangerous.
219) MARK
[pickup2] So, what's your take on the brothers? They seem to have this place tied down pretty well.
220) 
What do you mean?
222) 
They've been pretty generous.
223) 
They're delaying the inevitable.
224) 
We can take this place if we have to.
225) LEE
[pickup2] What do you mean by that?
226) LEE
[pickup2] They've been pretty generous so far.
227) MARK
[pickup2] Yeah, definitely. I mean, I know we're not getting something for nothin', but still...
228) MARK
[pickup2] Well, they seem decent enough. I just want you to know that I've got your back if anything goes down.
229) MARK
[pickup2] So... about that guy in the woods... Did we do the right thing? Just leaving him there?
230) LEE
[pickup2][matter-of-fact] There was nothing we could do.
231) LEE
[pickup2][matter-of-fact] We did all we could, Mark.
232) LEE
[pickup2][unsure] I don't know.
233) MARK
[pickup2] It's just been getting to me.
234) LEE
[tense/under fire]No idea!
237) MARK
[pickup2] But I...
238) MARK
[pickup2][just shot though the neck] Uggkkkkk!
239) LEE
[pickup2][just saw Mark get shot through the neck] Oh, fuck!
240) LEE
[pickup2][terrified] What the hell!?
241) MARK
[pickup3][pickup2] We're gonna have to move it. That maniac isn't gonna stop!
242) BANDIT
[pickup2] Where's our food you assholes!?
243) BANDIT
[pickup2] You didn't deliver the goods! Now we're gonna take what's owed!
244) BANDIT
[pickup2] We had an agreement! Now you're fucked!
245) MARK
[pickup2] I can't wait until everyone's out here. Everyone besides Larry...
246) MARK
[pickup2] Look, you said it.
247) MARK
[pickup2] You even admitted it right to him.
248) MARK
[pickup2]You admitted it to him anyway...
249) LEE
[pickup2] It's useless without gas. We might need food, but the St. Johns need gas too.
250) 
It's useless without gas.
251) MARK
[pickup2] I suppose...
252) MARK
[pickup2] Not if we all work together. They're really taking care of this place.
253) MARK
[pickup2][sad, context: You're probably right that this place will fall eventually]Maybe you're right.
254) MARK
And by the sounds of it, you're just counting the hours before it does.
257) MARK
And by the sounds of it, you're just counting the hours before it does.
256) MARK
[pickup2] It's encouraging to see how well they take care of this place.
258) MARK
[pickup2] You said it. I'm really happy we took them up on their offer.
259) MARK
[pickup2] Out here, it's almost like things used to be.
261) MARK
[pickup2] Out here, it's almost like things used to be.
270) MARK
[pickup2] Out here, it's almost like things used to be.
260) MARK
[pickup2] See? I knew you'd change your mind eventually!
262) LEE
[pickup2] I'm not so sure. We don't know anything about this place.
265) LEE
[pickup2] I'm not so sure. We don't know anything about this place.
263) MARK
[pickup2] Oh, come on. You seemed really into the idea back there!
264) LEE
[pickup2] I've been thinking it over, that's all.
266) MARK
[pickup2] I know you're not sold, but I think this place is perfect!
267) MARK
[pickup2] God, can you imagine it? There's more than enough room for us all!
268) MARK
[pickup2] Oh yeah? Changing your tune I see! You didn't seem so gung-ho before!
271) MARK
You're crazy. Everyone else is so excited!
272) MARK
[pickup2] Woulda been nice to get some of those rations. I get hungry too, ya know.
273) MARK
[pickup2] Thanks for the rations earlier. It's not easy eating in front of the kids, but it's all that's keeping me on my feet right now.
276) LEE
[pickup2b][underfire frm the bandits, lee figures out what to do next]I just gotta get to that gate!
277) LEE

279) LEE
[pickup2b][having reached the safety of the gate, Lee looks back toward Mark's dead body.]Sorry, Mark.  [then, to himself, getting angry] What the fuck is going on around here?!
282) 
We still need to be careful.
284) 
It doesnt matter.
285) 
Maybe a farm hand.
286) LEE
[pickup2][looking at a dead zombie on the fence]At least it's not one of us.
287) 
At least it's not one of us.

346) LEE
[pickup3b]Yeah, it's pretty amazing what they've done with this dairy.  But let's see what it takes to secure this fence before drawing any conclusions.
347) LEE
[pickup3b]Well, we don't want to seem over anxious.  Showing them we can handle this fence is gonna go a long way.

[ambient conversation]What do you do for a living, Ken?
16) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I.. uh... I was a fisherman down in Fort Lauderdale.
17) DANNY
[ambient conversation]If we were lucky we'd bring in a Sturgeon or two, but man... Never been out in the deep sea.
18) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Man, that sounds nice! Daddy used to take us out for largemouth bass when we were kids.
19) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Commercially, Snapper and Yellowfin mostly. But in the summers I'd take tourists out for some sailfish!
20) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I tell ya, there ain't nothing like fresh tuna straight from the sea - to the grill - to the plate!!  Especially the way Kat cooks it up!
21) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]I met Ken after I opened my Veterinary office. He came in with a sick octopus!
22) KENNY
[ambient conversation]What?  Where else was i gonna take it?
23) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Where ya from Katjaa?  That accent sure ain't from Georgia!
24) KATJAA
[ambient conversation][friendly]No, definitely not!  My family is from Latvia, but we moved to Florida when I was in my teens.
25) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Dan, did you always work here at the dairy?
26) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Me?  No, that was Daddy's business.  I ran an insurance company over in Decatur.
27) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I hear that.
28) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, anyway, it was good business.  But then all this shit went down, and I had to come home.  Family's more important, ya know?
29) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, well Dan felt it would be best to get away from Macon for a while. Had some... trouble.
30) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Decatur?
31) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Well, I took over as business manager eventually. Put that college degree to work.
32) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]What did you do before that?
33) ANDY
[ambient conversation]I had a real estate business, but, you know... in this economy...
34) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, Daddy always wanted you to take over anyway.
35) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Just worked out that way, Dan.
36) LARRY
[ambient conversation]How long ya had this Dairy?
37) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Long as I can remember.  We grew up here.  Dan and I helped out where we could, but really this was a Mom and Pop business.
38) LILLY
[ambient conversation]So you two didn't work here?
39) ANDY
[ambient conversation]So how long you been a vet?
40) DANNY
[ambient conversation]You work with many farm animals?
41) KATJAA
[ambient conversation][trying to think back] Ooh... well... a long time now.
42) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Early in my training I did, but then mostly it was household pets.
43) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]I started working in a vet's office in my twenties, then got my license a few years later.
44) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Oh, yes. Wildlife Rescue Center was always bringing their injured alligators to me to get patched up before releasing them.
45) DUCK
[ambient conversation]And alligators!
46) CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]Nu uh!
47) LILLY
[ambient conversation]So that fence does a good job of keeping the walkers out?
48) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Once, my dad smashed one in the face with a TV!
49) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Sorry.
50) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah. Unfortunately we lost most of our livestock before we managed to get the thing rigged up.
51) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Kenny Jr!  That is not appropriate talk at the dinner table.
52) DANNY
[ambient conversation][mumbled]Damned walkers.
53) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Our hunting trips have turned up nothing. The walkers are eating anything living they can get their teeth into.
54) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Well, ya just have to know what to hunt.  There's meat out there that'll keep you alive if ya know what to look for.
55) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Thanks again for this meal.  You have no idea how long it's been!
56) KENNY
[ambient conversation]How've you folks managed to find food?
57) ANDY
[ambient conversation]And what do you do Miss Lilly?
58) LARRY
[ambient conversation]Lilly's a military woman.  Takes after her old man.
59) DANNY
[ambient conversation]That right?  Ever see any action?
60) LILLY
[ambient conversation][blunt, emotionless]I have.
61) LARRY
[ambient conversation]Son, you don't ever ask a soldier that question, ya got it?
62) LARRY
[ambient conversation]All you need to know is that you don't wanna fuck with her. Period.
63) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Dad...
64) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, I'm sorry.
65) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Don't pay my brother no mind.  I swear he makes a hobby of chewing his own foot.
66) ANDY
[ambient conversation]So did ya'all know each other before the outbreak?
67) LILLY
[ambient conversation]No. We just sort of found ourselves thrown together.
68) LILLY
[ambient conversation]But now we've gotta stick together if we're gonna survive.
69) ANDY
[ambient conversation]I hear ya.  Ya gotta know when to make sacrifices for the greater good, ya know.
70) KENNY
[ambient conversation]It ain't right, though.  No kid should have to see the things they've seen.
71) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Kids are resilient, you know?  I hate that this is the way they have to grow up, but under the circumstances, I think they're doing well.
72) DANNY
[ambient conversation]How the kids been dealing with... everything?
73) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Maybe I should check on him?
74) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Let the man clean up. He'll be done in a minute.
75) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Are we gonna eat soon, momma?
76) LARRY
[ambient conversation]How long does it take to wash your damn hands?
77) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]As soon as Lee gets back.
78) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, Maybelle is the only one we have left.
79) DANNY
[ambient conversation][cont.] She provides the milk.
80) CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]I like your cow.  She's pretty.
81) DANNY
[ambient conversation]That's why we need Katjaa's help.
82) DANNY
[ambient conversation]We'd love to have another healthy calf, but we mostly want to make sure Maybelle's okay.
83) LEE

184) LEE
[pickup2]It's just you and me...Lilly's in no condition to help us rescue your family.
185) KENNY
[pickup2]Considering what just happened, she'd probably side with the St. Johns against us.
186) LEE
[pickup2]Katjaa and Duck.
187) KENNY
[pickup2]We've got to get to them!
188) KENNY

[pickup2] [interrupting, vehement]No! [Beat]They-They need Katjaa, remember? She's the whole reason they brought us here.
189) LEE
[pickup2]You don't think the St. Johns...[killed them...?]
190) LEE
[pickup2]Sure.  And Duck is valuable as a bargaining chip.
191) KENNY
[pickup2][apprehensive] What about 'em?
192) LEE
[pickup2]You think maybe we were too hasty?
193) KENNY
[pickup2]Only one important thing right now... getting the fuck outta here.  We did what we had to.
194) LEE
[pickup2]You wanna do the honors and search Larry's pockets?
195) KENNY
[pickup2]I'm not going near Lilly, not now. If somebody's gotta search his pockets, it better be you.
196) LEE
[pickup2][confrontational] Look, if we're gonna survive this shit, we've got to work together.  How do you expect Lilly to work with us after what she just saw you do?
197) LEE
[pickup2][confrontational]You talk a big game, but could you do the "hard thing" if it was Katjaa or Duck?
198) LEE
[pickup2]I know it was necessary, but... I just wish Clem didn't have to witness shit like this.  I worry what it's gonna do to her.
199) KENNY
[pickup2]I don't want to hear it, Lee.
200) KENNY
[pickup2][angry self-justification] You think I liked doing what I did? I'm the guy who couldn't bear to watch the family dog get put down. But if we wanna survive this shit, we gotta have the balls to do the hard thing. [under his breath] Or at least, one of us's got to.
201) KENNY
[pickup2]If she wants to live, she'll work with us.  If she doesn't, then the hell with her.
203) KENNY
[pickup2][defensive] What?  You don't want to hang me up on a meathook and leave me to rot?
204) LEE
[pickup2]What I WANT isn't important. What I KNOW is: there's safety in numbers.

[pickup2][defiant] It's never gonna come to that, not if I have anything to do with it!
208) KENNY
[pickup2]I know I'm right!  [half to himself]I just gotta get to 'em, that's all.
209) LEE
[pickup2]I hope you're right...
210) KENNY
[pickup2]And no doubt they're usin' Duck as a bargaining chip.
212) LEE
[pickup2]She's an impressionable little girl!  What's a thing like this gonna teach her?
213) KENNY
[pickup2]How to survive, that's what.  That's the best lesson she can learn.
214) LEE
[pickup2]It's Clementine I'm worried about.  Her seein' what you did...
215) KENNY
[pickup2][resentful] He wasn't HER father.
216) KENNY
[pickup2]That's the ONLY thing I'm thinkin' about.  And I still think the air-conditioner duct's our best bet.
217) LEE
[pickup2]Any thoughts on getting out of here?
218) KENNY
[pickup2]You fixin' to lecture me again? Or you lookin' to get a man's opinion on something?

[pickup2] [choked sob]
229) LEE
[pickup2]I'm sorry, Lilly.  I truly am. Larry and me, we might not've got along so great, but I know he would've done anything to protect you.  He was a good father.
231) LEE
[pickup2]Kenny... he made a bad call.  It was premature, for sure, but... he WAS trying to keep us safe.
232) LILLY
[pickup2][weary from weeping] Bullshit. He cares about keeping his FAMILY safe. He doesn't give a shit about you and me.
233) LEE
[pickup2][granting her point]He puts his family first, sure.  Just like Larry did.
234) LILLY
[pickup2][weary]I know.  There's nothing to be said.
235) LILLY
[pickup2][under her breath, with venom]He'll learn.  Wait 'till it happens to him...
236) LILLY
[pickup2][weary and cold]In other words, my father's more useful to you dead than alive.
237) LEE
[pickup2]If he was alive, and had the key to getting us out of here, do you think he'd keep it to himself?
238) LILLY
[pickup2][long sigh] Do what you have to do.
239) LEE
[pickup2]Your permission.
240) LILLY
[pickup2]What do you want? My blessing to loot his corpse?
241) LEE
[pickup2][mildly surprised] Huh!  He still carried his wallet...
242) LEE
[pickup2]A ring.
243) LEE
[pickup2]Don't worry.  I'm not takin' it.
244) LILLY
[pickup2][apprehensive lest Lee take it]My mother's...
245) LEE

[pickup2]Here we go...
247) LEE
[pickup2]God knows you deserve time to grieve, Lilly.
248) LILLY
[pickup2][weary] Please.  I need to be alone.
251) LEE
[pickup2]Never mind.
252) LILLY
[pickup2]Beat. She glares at him.
253) LEE
[pickup2]What do you want me to do?
254) LILLY
[pickup2][under her breath] And don't look at me, either.
255) LILLY
[pickup2]He's got his family, and you've got Clementine.  I've got nothing.  You've left me with nothing.
256) LILLY
[pickup2][snapping]For what?
257) LEE
[pickup2]I know you hate Kenny... and me, too.  But he did what he had to... so we can all go on living.
258) LILLY
[pickup2][snapping]Fuck you!  You think he wanted THIS?
259) LEE
[pickup2][more gently]He'd want you to get out of here.

262) LEE
[pickup2][trying to calm her] Of course not, but--
263) LILLY
[pickup2][interrupting]You don't know what he wanted! You never knew him! You never gave him a chance!
264) LEE
[pickup2][louder, shutting her down] Maybe not! Maybe-Maybe I should've tried harder.  But I know he loved YOU.
265) LEE
[pickup2]You've got to pull yourself together, Lilly.
266) LILLY
[pickup2][weary] Why? [Beat] For your sake... so you can feel better about... about what you DID?
267) LILLY
[pickup2][flat] Right.  Because you fucking care SO much about ME...
268) LEE
[pickup2]For your OWN sake.
269) LILLY
[pickup2][without looking up]Why can't you just leave me alone...?
513) LILLY

[pickup2]I know.  We're gonna get out of here and find them.
289) KENNY
[pickup2]I wouldn't be hanging around in here if I knew a way out.
290) LEE
[pickup2]Ya found a way out yet?
291) KENNY
[pickup2]Ya' inspected all the walls?  Maybe there's a vent or a duct or something.
292) LARRY
[pickup2][Normal tone of voice] Yeah, I wanna attract their attention [...up to a yell] so I can fucking kill them!
293) LEE
[pickup2][softly, trying to reason with him]C'mon, Larry.  Do you really want to attract their attention?

402) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]What the hell is your problem?
403) LEE
[pickup2][offhand but cutting] Guess your new girlfriend wasn't all she was cracked up to be.
404) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]You refused to give me my day's rations back at the motor lodge...
405) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]You were a prick back at the motor lodge...
406) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]Then you practically fuckin' push my face into that goddamn human barbeque.
407) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing] ...and you went out of your way to be an asshole to me tonight.
408) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing] You must really hate me.
409) LEE
[pickup2][defiant]No... you're not worth the energy to hate....
410) LEE
[pickup2]I'm not your enemy, Larry.
411) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing] I don't believe you.
412) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]But guess what? You're stuck with me.  I plan to be around long after you're gone. And if you turn...
413) LARRY
[pickup2][very intimate]I'll be the one to put the axe through your skull.
414) LARRY
[pickup2]Open up, goddamnit!
415) LILLY
[pickup2][scandalized] Dad!!
416) LEE
[pickup2][to himself] Fuck it.
417) KENNY
[pickup2][hopeful]Think we could heave it through the door?
418) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Could there be a hole behind these pallets...?
419) LEE
[pickup2]No such luck.
420) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]What's this...some kind of vent?
421) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Too small to do us any good.
422) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]But there's no way out through the ceiling.
423) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Shelves are pretty sturdy. We could climb up...
424) LILLY
[pickup2][concerned]Easy...
425) LARRY
[pickup2][in pain] Aah!
426) LARRY
[pickup2][ranting]I'll break the damn door down!
427) LILLY
[pickup2][alarmed]Dad!  You can't get--
428) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]I wonder.... [louder, to the group]There ought to be an air duct behind this unit... maybe big enough for one of us to fit through....
429) KENNY
[pickup2][dubious] I dunno, Lee... seems like a longshot.
430) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][hopeful]Does the air-conditioner come off?
431) LEE
[pickup2][examining the unit]I think I could take it off... if I had something to remove the screws...
432) LEE
[pickup2][crestfallen]Of course they took it. Shit.
433) LEE
[pickup2][remembering]The multitool!
434) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][hopeful]Maybe there's something else we could use.  I've got a rock.
435) LEE
[pickup2]A rock won't help... [thinks]but a COIN might do the trick.  Do you have a coin?
436) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][disappointed]Uh-uh...
437) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]That air-duct is our best bet for getting out of here!
438) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]I just need a coin or something to remove the screws...
439) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Just gotta remove these screws and get this unit off...
440) LEE
[pickup2][biting the bullet, slowly and clearly]I think I may have found a way out of here.  But I need something to remove the screws on the air-conditioner.
441) LILLY
[pickup2][flatly]No.
442) LEE
[pickup2][uncomfortable]If you had something I could use as a screwdriver...a coin or something...
443) LEE
[pickup2][uncomfortable]What about HIM?  Look, I know this is a terrible time for it, but...
444) LEE
[pickup2][continuing, uncomfortable]...back at the Motor Inn, Larry mentioned something about keeping coins in his pockets...
445) LEE
[pickup2][continuing, uncomfortable]...if there's a chance Larry has a coin or something in one of his pockets...it might be the thing that saves our lives.
446) LILLY
[pickup2][under her breath] Fucking vulture...
447) LEE
But if we're gonna get out of here, we need your help.  And Larry's...
449) LEE
But if we're gonna get out of here, we need your help.  And Larry's...
451) LEE
But if we're gonna get out of here, we need your help.  And Larry's...
448) LEE
[pickup2][with sympathy]I'm sorry, Lilly...
450) LEE
[pickup2][with sympathy]I'm sorry, Lilly...
452) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][Lee has asked Clem to stay and take care of Lilly (after Lillys farther has died] I will.
453) KENNY
[pickup2][calling out from the next room, but trying to be relatively quiet, not attracting attention] Get in here, I got an idea.
454) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][still sniffling]Like what?
455) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][more sobbing]
456) LEE
[pickup2][consoling]Shh... I know, I know. But you gotta be strong right now. I need you to be strong. Think about something else... something hopeful.
457) LEE
[pickup3][somber - comforthing Clementine after larry's death]Getting out of here.
458) LEE
[pickup3][somber - comforthing Clementine after larry's death]Someplace safe, where no monsters can get you.
459) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Sometimes.
460) LEE
[pickup3][The new read should be more somber]How about your walkie-talkie... those pretend talks with your Mom and Dad.  Don't those make you feel better?
461) LEE
[pickup2][consoling her] I'm workin' on it!
462) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][shyly]We're gonna get out, right? You found a way out?
463) LEE
[pickup2]They didn't hurt you, did they?
464) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][answering in the negative]Mm-mm.
465) LEE
[pickup2]The air-conditioner... there might be a duct behind it....
466) KENNY
[pickup2][distracted, not listening] Oh God!  What're they doin' to Katjaa and Duck...?
467) LEE
[pickup2]If the duct behind the air-conditioner is big enough, we might've found our way out of here...
468) KENNY
[pickup2][hopeful] Yeah?
469) LEE
[pickup2] But I need something to loosen the screws.
470) KENNY
[disappointed]I got nothin'. [to himself]Shit!
471) LEE
[pickup2]Hang tight... maybe I can scrounge something.
472) KENNY
[pickup2]Well shit, man, go see if you can get the bolts off!
473) LEE
[pickup2] I got a coin off Larry!
484) LEE
[pickup2] I got a coin off Larry!
474) 
You wanna search Larry's pockets?
477) 
You wanna search Larry's pockets?
475) 
The air-conditioner might be our way out.
479) LEE
[pickup2][half to himself]The air-conditioner!
480) 
I need a coin or something...
481) LEE
[pickup2][insistent]Listen, I need a coin or something.
482) LEE
[pickup2][more insistent]It's important!  It could get us out of here!
483) KENNY
[pickup2][surly]Well, I got nothin'.
485) KENNY
[pickup2][surly]So... go fuckin' loosen the bolts, if you think that'll help.

You murdered Larry.
154) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryA}I did what nobody else would.
155) LEE
[pickup2] {disgustedB}You destroyed this group, Kenny. There's no coming back from it.
156) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}Everything's going to be different now.
157) LEE
[pickup2] {normalD}Kenny, you're not a bad man. {sadA}But fuck... What the hell are we going to do now?
158) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}You're no hero. {angryA}You destroyed TWO lives in that meat locker.
159) KENNY
[pickup2] {disgustA}Well, maybe we should stay out of each others way for a while.
160) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}I couldn't do it, Ken.
161) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryA}I don't care. You do what you have to do, {disgustA}I'm-a keep doing what needs to be done.
162) KENNY
[pickup2] {sadA}Fine, then. {disgustA}Fine. I saved Duck on the farm and didn't save Shawn. Now I kill someone before it can put your little girl in danger, and {fearA}I'm even more of a monster.
163) LEE
[pickup2] [to clementine] {normalD}Scary day, huh.
164) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] {sadB}Yeah. It's okay now, though.
165) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][scared, also do a flat, cold one]{sadB}Yes.
166) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] This stuff isn't ours.
167) LILLY
[pickup2] [cold] If they come back, then we're just monsters who came out of the woods and ruined their lives.
168) KENNY
[pickup2] {normalC}Whatever man, it's gonna get cold out eventually.
169) LEE
[pickup2] {normalC}She's good. Thanks.
170) KATJAA
[pickup2][calling out] {normalC}Lee, there's a hoodie in here, could probably fit Clementine.
171) DOUG
[pickup2] ...Were you guys able to salvage anything good from the dairy?
172) DOUG
[pickup2] It's just a basic camcorder. A Save Lots cheapie. Let me check it out, see if I can get it working.
173) CARLEY
[pickup2] {happyB}Hey, Lee.  There were some batteries in the back.  I thought they might work in your camcorder.
174) JOLENE
[pickup2][crazy, screaming into a self-shot camcorder] JAKE, BART, LINDA and ALL YA'LL FUCKIN' SICKOS FROM THE SAVE-LOTS! THEY CALL YA'LL BANDITS! BUT YOU'RE FUCKING RAPIST MONSTERS--
175) JOLENE
[pickup2][quietly narrating a video from the bushes. like discovery channel. but by a crazy person] Look'ee here. Jake, you don't know about these folk yet do you... because you're too distracted by that stupid farm.
176) JOLENE
[pickup2][quietly narrating a video from the bushes. like discovery channel. but by a crazy person] Oh darlin', baby. Look at you. Look. At. You. Oh, you need a mama, sweetheart. We won't let them bandits get you, will we... No.
177) LEE
[pickup2] Not really. St. John's took everyting I had before the place got completely overrun with walkers.
178) LEE
[pickup2] It doesn't work.  You have any use for it, Doug?
179) 
We're not like the bandits.
180) 
Just hold onto it for safe-keeping.
182) DUCK
[pickup2] {fearA}Dad, whose car is it?
183) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryA}Don't worry about that Duck, it's ours now.
184) KATJAA
[pickup2] {happyA}It's abandoned, Ducky. Don't worry.
185) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] {fearA}What if it's not?
186) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] What if it's not abandoned? What if it IS someone's?
187) LEE
[pickup2] {angryA}No, Clementine is right. We can't rob from people, even if we don't know if they're around.
188) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryB}What?! Did you get some meal back there the rest of us missed out on?! We HAVE to take this stuff.
189) 
I don't want any part of it.
190) 
We'll survive without it.
197) LEE
[pickup2] {normalC}We'll survive without it.
191) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryC}Suit yourself.
192) KENNY
[pickup2][pissed] {thinkingA}Fine. Suit yourself.
193) LEE
[pickup2][sarcastic, mean] {angryA}You're on a real tear today, huh.
194) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryA}What do you mean by that?
195) LEE
[pickup2] {angryC}Come on, Kenny. Between this and the meat locker you know what it means.
196) LEE
[pickup2] {normalC}We'll find a way.
198) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryC}The hell we will!
199) LEE
[pickup2] {angryA}Clementine and I don't wany any part of this.
200) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryB}We're starving!
201) KENNY
[pickup2]{angryB}The rest of us are taking this stuff.
202) KENNY
[pickup2][Kenny is still sore that Lee didnt have is back in the meatlocker, but Lee DID save Katjaa from Brenda]{angryA}I want to thank you for getting Katjaa out of that house, {disgustA}but that doesn't change what happened in the meat locker.
203) 
You're on a tear today, huh.
204) 
We've done enough damage already.
205) LEE
[pickup2]{angryB}We've done enough damage already.
206) KATJAA
[pickup2][taking a box from Kenny]{normalB}Yeah.  I got it.
207) BEN
[pickup2][taking a box from Kenny]{normalB}Enh..
208) KENNY
[pickup2][in the background, Kenny gves out Boxes of stuff]{normalC}Got it?
209) KENNY
[pickup2][in the background, Kenny gives out Boxes of stuff]{normalC}Here...
210) DOUG
[pickup2][spooked by what he saw on the camcorder he just fixed] {normalC}Hey...Lee?  {happyB}You know that camcorder?  I got it working....you might wanna see this.
211) LEE
[pickup2]{happyA}Thanks.
212) LEE
[pickup2][Spooked by what he sees on the camcorder][under his breath]...Oh, shit.
213) CARLEY
[pickup2][sweetly, giving batteries to Clem]Here, you can have some too... for your walkie-talkie.
214) DOUG
[pickup2][awarkly hand Clem something to play with] {happyC}Here, Clem.  Want some... uhh.. batteries?
215) LEE
[pickup2]Good timing, Doug.
216) DOUG
[pickup2]Hey, Lee.  I think I fixed this thing.  Just had to press a couple jumpers back in.  It needs some batteries, but it should work.
217) CARLEY
[pickup2] {happyA}Why don't you keep it. Sometimes it helps to have something you can document your thoughts on.
218) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}Do you want it?
219) CARLEY
[pickup2] {sadA}Katjaa managed to grab this while she was in the house.  She said it was with your stuff.
220) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}Yeah.  I found it while I was looking for the people who shot Mark.
221) KATJAA
[pickup2][remembering]Oh!  I was able to grab a couple of your things back while Brenda wasn't looking...
225) DOUG
Let me check it out, see if I can get it working.
226) DOUG
[pickup2] It's just a basic camcorder. A Save Lots cheapie.
227) LEE
I think it's broken but, Danny seemed pretty interested in it until he found that out.
228) LEE
You have any use for it, Doug?
229) CARLEY
[pickup3][Lee teasing her about her lack of bettry skills]You're not gonna let me live that down, are you?
230) LEE
[pickup3][sarcastic, but still tired from the LONG day] Batteries huh? Think you can handle those?
231) CARLEY
[pickup3][horrified by what she sees on the video tape]  Oh, god.  Lee.  You're gonna want to see this...
232) CARLEY
[pickup3][handing Lee some batteries]Hey. There were some batteries in one of those boxes.  I thought they might work in your camcorder.
233) KENNY
[pickup3][pissed, but keeping it between Lee & Kenny]Look, I don't know where you think we stand right now, so let me make it perfectly clear.
234) KENNY
[pickup3][laying it down for Lee]Once we get back to the motor inn, I'm getting that RV running and me and my family are taking off... without you and that girl, got it?
235) LEE
[pickup3][Stern & defensive]You MURDERED Larry.
236) LEE
[pickup3]Yeah, I know.  I've got your back, we made the right choice, but what the hell happens now?
237) LEE
[pickup3][having kenny's back]It'll be fine.  Lilly will get over it.  She has to. You're a better leader for us anyway.
238) KENNY
[pickup3][confiding in Lee about the RV]Listen, that RV back at the motor inn is just about ready to roll.  I want you to come with us.  I mean it.
239) KENNY
[pickup3][changing his mind about not bringing Lee in the RV] Listen, that RV back at the motor in is just about ready.  I've changed my mind. I want you to come with us when we leave.
240) LEE
[pickup3][accepting the ride invitation] Okay, yeah.
241) LEE
[pickup3]Yeah?
242) KENNY
[pickup3][explaining why he changed his mind about Lee] Hell yeah.  We're a team, man.  Me and you!  By taking out Larry before he turned, you saved all of us in that meat locker!  And that saved my family too.  Yeah, I'd say you earned it!
243) KENNY
[pickup3]I don't care what I said to you before...
244) LEE
[pickup3]I saved your wife and kid!
245) KENNY
[pickup3]You are a sad excuse for a man.  You constantly put me and my family last.
246) KENNY
[pickup3]No, I saved them!  By making sure Larry didn't kill US!
247) KENNY
Baby, you've gotta see this!
248) KENNY
{happyC}There is a shit load of food and supplies back here!
249) KENNY
[pickup3][looting the car]{happyC}Okay, what have we got in here?
250) BEN
[pickup3][looting the car]{happyC}Look, there's more food in that box!
251) KATJAA
[pickup3][looting the car]{happyC}They have antibiotics!  Is there any more?
252) DOUG
[pickup3][looting the car]Any electronics?  Radios? Batteries?
253) CARLEY
[pickup3][looting the car]{thinkingA}See if there's any water...
254) LEE
[pickup3][follows 310423699]I never thought a laser pointer would be the thing that saved our lives.
258) LEE
[pickup3][follows 310423800]If you hadn't taken that shot at Andy, we might not have gotten out of there.
259) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3] Lee... Did you have to kill those men?
260) 
Yes.  They were bad.
261) 
I'm sorry you saw that.
262) 
I shouldn't have done that
263) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]... Yes.  I think so.
264) LEE
[pickup3]Yes.  They were bad men, Clementine.  They killed Mark and were going to kill all of us.  They had to be stopped. Understand?
265) LEE
[pickup3][feeing a bit guilty]I... I'm sorry you had to see that.   But I only did it to protect us.
266) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Because they tried to hurt us?
267) LEE
[pickup3]Yes.
268) LEE
[pickup3]I.. I wasnt thinking.  I was anrgy, and I was scared. But I did the wrong thing.  You should never kill somebody unless you absolutely have to, okay?
269) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Why did you?
270) LEE
[pickup3][feeling guilty]I... I shouldn't have done that.  They were very bad men, Clementine, but that doesn't mean I had to kill them.
272) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][sad that people are dead, but]...I'm glad WE'RE still alive.
273) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Lee... Are those bad people dead?
274) 
Yes.  Walkers probably got em.
275) 
We didn't kill them, so I don't know.
276) 
No, they are alive and suffering.
277) LEE
[pickup3]Yes.  Walkers probably got 'em.  They were very bad people and were punished for it.
278) LEE
[pickup3]We didn't kill them, so I don't know.  They might have been able to get away from the walkers, but I'm sure they wont be coming after us.
279) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]That's good.
280) LEE
[pickup3]No, they are alive and suffering.  They were very bad people, but if they die, it won't be because I killed them.
281) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][sad]It's okay.  We don't have to talk about it.
282) LILLY
[pickup3][still fairly emotionless] You know, Dad told me about you... what you did to the senator... I didn't think you had it in you, but after tonight...
283) LILLY
[pickup3]...I just hope you're doing it for the right reasons.
284) LILLY
[pickup3]You know, my Dad told me about you... about what happened with the senator...
285) LEE
[pickup3] Lilly I-
286) LILLY
[pickup3]Look, I don't care what happened in your past.  Tonight I saw what kind of man you are.  You could have killed every one of them, but you didn't.  I think that says a lot.
287) LEE
[pickup2] I stopped her. This fucking world, now. It's hiding just, unspeakable shit at every turn.
289) 
Food
290) 
[pickup2][quietly narrating a video from the bushes. like discovery channel. but by a crazy person] Regarde, Jake. Tu ne les connais pas encore, et pourtant… Parce que tu es trop distrait par cette stupide ferme.
291) 
[pickup2][quietly narrating a video from the bushes. like discovery channel. but by a crazy person] Oh, ma chérie. Regarde-toi. Regarde. Tu as besoin d'une maman, ma chérie. On ne va pas laisser ces bandits te faire du mal.

1) ANDY
[pickup3][ambient]We've got a good system set up for that, but it runs on gas.  You folks are really helping us out.
2) DANNY
[pickup3]And with the vegetables we grow, we've got plenty of food.
3) MARK
[pickup3]So, this dairy... you guys really have food?
4) ANDY
[pickup3]Sure do.  We've lost most of the cattle, but we still have lots of milk, butter and cheese stocked up.
5) BEN
[pickup3][ambient]And the dead things... they aren't destroying everything?
6) DOUG
[pickup3]Sure.  I'd like to get a look at that electric fence they talked about.  It might give me some ideas for something I can rig up at the motor inn.
7) LEE
[pickup3][noticing doug is carrying something]What's that you've got there?
8) DOUG
[pickup3]Oh.  Nothing.  Just a laser pointer I picked up during our last trip to the drugstore.
9) LEE
[pickup3][casual]Thanks for coming along, Doug.
10) CARLEY
[pickup3][casual]It's nice to get away from that motel for a while.  This Lilly/Kenny thing is starting to get ridiculous.
11) CARLEY
[pickup3]Personally I'd be happier if you started to take charge more.
12) LEE
[pickup3]Kenny keeps us motivated.  He believes in hope and knows how important it is for us to not give that up.  I can't fault him for that.
13) LEE
[pickup3]Lilly's way of running things is smart.  It's not easy, but it's keeping us alive.
14) LEE
[pickup3][doubting himself]You think they'd want me for a leader?
15) 
Kenny keeps us motivated.
16) 
Lilly is a smart leader.
17) 
Me as a leader?
18) CARLEY
[pickup3] Sure. Everybody looks up to you.
19) CARLEY
[pickup3]Or maybe you just don't want to be in charge?
20) CARLEY
[pickup3]Or maybe you just don't want to be in charge?
21) LEE
[pickup3]Well... not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.
22) LEE
[pickup3]Well... not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.
23) LEE
[pickup3]Well... not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.
25) LEE
[pickup3]Well... not everyone thinks I'm so trustworthy.
24) CARLEY
[pickup3]You don't agree with me?[that Lee would be a good leader]
26) CARLEY
[pickup3][earenstly]Because of your past?
27) CARLEY
[pickup3]What exactly DID happen with the senator?
28) LEE
[pickup3]...It was an accident.  I mean, I pretty much knew about the affair...
29) 
It was an accident.
30) CARLEY
[pickup3][slightly hushed, dropping her voice] Does anyone else know?
31) LEE
[pickup3]["anyone else know about your past?" - Lying in an attempt to keep things simple. ]Just you.
32) LEE
[pickup3]Larry knows.
38) 
Larry knows.
33) CARLEY
[pickup3][understanding how bad it is that Larry knows lee's past]Great, that can't be easy.
34) LEE
[pickup3] It doesn't matter.
39) 
It doesn't matter.
35) LEE
[pickup3][feeling guilty]Clementine knows.
36) LEE
[pickup3] She was there when we were talking in the drugstore and asked me about it.
44) LEE
[pickup3] She was there when we were talking in the drugstore and asked me about it.
37) 
Just you.
40) LEE
[pickup3]I couldn't lie to her.
41) CARLEY
[pickup3] Well, I haven't told anyone.
42) CARLEY
[pickup3]You've got to let go of that guilt. The Lee I know is a good man.
43) CARLEY
[pickup3]You've got to let go of that guilt. The Lee I know is a good man.
45) LEE
[pickup3][feeling guilty]Clementine ... might know.
46) LEE
[pickup3]I lied to her, but... [She's not a stupid girl]
47) LEE
[pickup3] Now is not the time...
49) 
Now is not the time...
48) LEE
[pickup3]You know what happened...
50) 
You know what happened...
51) CARLEY
[pickup3][trying to get lee to open up]Listen, over the years I've reported on some pretty messed up shit.  I've seen situations like yours a hundred times, it doesn't make you a bad man...
52) CARLEY
[pickup3]Well, I'm here whenever you want to talk...
124) CARLEY
[pickup3]Well, I'm here whenever you want to talk...
53) CARLEY
[pickup3]I only know what the press was told.  I don't know your story.
54) MARK
[pickup3]I mean, thank God Lee showed up when he did!
55) ANDY
[pickup3] Yeah, why don't you tell us a little more about yourself, Lee?
56) DANNY
[pickup3]Where are ya from?
57) LEE
[pickup3]I grew up in Macon.
63) 
I grew up in Macon.
58) LEE
[pickup3]The motor inn is my home now I guess.
59) LEE
[pickup3]I move around a lot.  Hard to call any place home I guess.
60) ANDY
[pickup3][responding to Lee's silence.] Something tells me you're a local boy. You can always just kinda tell, ya know?
61) ANDY
[pickup3][friendly]Hm.  That place has seen better days, huh?
62) DANNY
[pickup3] I used to move around a bit myself, but the dairy will always be home to me.
64) 
The motor inn is my home now.
65) 
I move around a lot.
66) ANDY
[pickup3][admiring]Right in the Heart of Georgia, that's what I like to hear!
67) ANDY
[pickup3]Y'all seem pretty settled in at that motor inn.  Who's running things over there?
68) 
Lilly.
69) 
Kenny.
70) 
I am.
71) 
It's a democracy.
72) LEE
[pickup3]Lilly.  She runs a pretty tight ship.  Her and her dad are ex-military.
73) DOUG
[pickup3]We've actually made it pretty secure.
74) BEN
[pickup3]I like that alarm system you made.  That's pretty smart.
75) CARLEY
[pickup3][commenting on the fact that the motel has seen better days]You can say that again.
76) MARK
[pickup3] Yeah, she knows her shit, but she needs to know when to back off sometimes.
77) LEE
[pickup3] Kenny's the guy who really keeps the group together.
78) MARK
[pickup3]Heh, don't let Lilly hear you say that.
79) LEE
[pickup3]I am.  If you guys have any questions, you come to me.
80) LEE
[pickup3]We work as a group, all of us looking out for each other.
81) ANDY
[pickup3]I hear that!  There are so many dumbasses out there fighting  each other these days...  it's just stupid.
82) DANNY
[pickup3][friendly] How many people ya got over there anyway?
83) LEE
[pickup3]Nine. Including the kids.
90) 
Nine. Including the kids.
84) DOUG
[pickup3]Well, ten actually... if you count the new guy.
85) CARLEY
[pickup3]You forgot Ben.
86) BEN
[pickup3]Me?
87) CARLEY
[pickup3]That makes it ten.
88) LEE
[pickup3]Enough to defend ourselves.
91) 
Enough to defend ourselves.
89) ANDY
[pickup3]Well that's good!  It's getting dangerous out there, well, you guys know.
92) 
[Change the Subject]
93) LEE
[pickup3] Well, the kid here is our newest arrival, but we're all looking forward to some food.  We really need it.
94) ANDY
[pickup3]Well, here's to helping each other out!
96) ANDY
[pickup3]Well, here's to helping each other out!
95) MARK
[pickup3][chiming in after Lee remians silent] We've got a lot of hungry folks back there who really appreciate your food offer.
97) ANDY
[pickup3]Well, we'd love to get ya all out to the dairy.  Like I said, we've got plenty of food, and quite frankly, we could always use an extra helping hand.
98) BEN
[pickup3]In the summers, I used to help out on a goat farm.
99) DANNY
[pickup3]  Yeah, that's great. Everything helps!
100) ANDY
[pickup3]Momma's been running the dairy for as long as I can remember but now it's gettin- [hears a noise and cuts himself off]
101) BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance]You think you're gonna cut me out of this?
102) ANDY
[pickup3][paniced whisper]Shit!  Get down!
103) DANNY
[pickup3][whispering] Fuckin' bandits.
104) MARK
[pickup3][whispering] Who?
105) BEN
[pickup3] [whispering] Those look like the people who raided my camp!
106) LEE
[pickup3][whispering] Who are they?
107) ANDY
[pickup3] [whispering]Shh. Fucking assholes is who they are.
108) DOUG
[pickup3][whispering]What should we do?
109) CARLEY
[pickup3][whispering]There's only two of them.
110) DANNY
[pickup3][whispering]Oh no, there's a LOT more of em.
111) ANDY
[pickup3][whispering]Don't worry.  Danny and I have ya covered if something happens, but let's just wait this out and hope they move on.
112) BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance]You and Gary are always pulling this shit!  Don't think we haven't noticed.
113) BANDIT2
[pickup3][process: in the distance]No one is trying to cut you out of anything!
114) BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance]Fuck you, you KNEW we were hungry!  And you guys were keeping it all for yourselves!
115) BANDIT2
[pickup3][process: in the distance]Calm down, your paranoia is pissing everyone off!
116) BANDIT2
[pickup3][process: in the distance]Yeah, and you know what, we ate it all!  What are you gonna fucking do about it?
117) BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance] FUCK YOU!!
118) BEN
[pickup3][whispering- seeing a guy shoot another guy in the head][frightened gasp]
119) DOUG
[pickup3][whispering- seeing a guy shoot another guy in the head]Oh, shit!
120) CARLEY
[pickup3][whispering- seeing a guy shoot another guy in the head]Jesus!
121) BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance - Shooting a guy he's already killed] FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!
122) BANDIT1
[pickup3][process: in the distance ] Asshole.
123) ANDY
[pickup3][serious.  Hushed but not whispered]The world out here has gone to shit. Come on, let's get to the dairy where it's safe.
125) LEE
[pickup3]Not sure everyone would see it that way.
126) CARLEY
[pickup3]You don't have to. Whatever happened before things went to hell doesn't matter anymore.
127) CARLEY
[pickup3]Maybe you're right...
128) LEE
[pickup3]Sometimes I wonder if I should talk to the group about it...
129) LEE
[pickup3][genuine]I really appreciate that.
130) MARK
[pickup3] Right Lee?
131) LEE
[pickup3]Can an electric fence really stop walkers?
132) LEE
[pickup3]I guess so...
133) DOUG
[pickup3]The electricity basically cooks you from the inside out, right?
134) DOUG
[pickup3]So if a walker stays in contact with the fence, it'll eventually cook its brain. Probably takes a while though.
135) DOUG
[pickup3]As long as the walkers aren't completely dehydrated, and the fence has enough juice, yeah, seems plausble.
136) DOUG
[pickup3][afterthought]...and that can't be a good smell.  ...Unless it smells like jerky... Man, I could go for some jerky.
137) DOUG
[pickup3]I shouldn't have turned down that food you offered me earlier.
138) DOUG
[pickup3][slightly embarased]Heh.  Sorry.
139) LEE
[pickup3][chuckles slightly]Heh heh... that is one runaway train of thought.
140) MARK
[pickup3][ambient]People were just grabbing food, guns, water... whatever they could get their hands on.
141) BEN
[pickup3][ambient]Well.. gas is free now, right?
142) ANDY
[pickup3][ambient]It is IF you can get it.  I'd rather pull up to a gas station and pay five dollars at the pump than try to fight of some dead guy.
143) MARK
[pickup3]Man, you shoulda seen how people went crazy back at the air force base.  When the place got overrun, it turned into chaos!
144) MARK
[pickup3][ambient]Ya know, it seems like just yesterday I was complaining about the price of gas being so high.  I guess that's nothing compared to now.
145) BEN
[pickup]That's just how it was on the bus.
146) MARK
[pickup3][ambient]Somehow I ended up getting locked in one of the commissary storage closets.
147) ANDY
[pickup3][ambient]Or worse, a bunch of hoarders!

48) MARK
[pickup2] [disapointed that the zombies got to their food(a rabbit)] {sadA} Well, that's another meal lost.
49) LEE
[pickup2] [hunting with Mark in the woods, Wondering what a zombie was eating] {thinkingB} Looks like a rabbit.
50) LEE
[pickup2] [hunting with Mark in the woods, after losing a rabbit] {disgustA} A rabbit's hardly a meal, Mark,  but... I'd take it. We're all hungry.
51) MARK
[pickup2][Responding to "We need something that will feed all of us"] {thinkingA} No kidding.
52) MARK
[pickup2] [cont] {disgustA} Last night I heard your friend Doug laying in bed just naming types of pie. It was driving me nuts. I think he's starting to lose it.
53) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA} He's not the only one. Won't you cut him some slack.
54) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA} We're all on edge. Just cut her some slack.
55) MARK
[pickup2] {disgustA} When I accidentally grabbed for Carley's rations the other night, I thought she was gonna take off my hand!
56) MARK
[pickup2][agreeing that the lack of food is making everyone on egde] {normalB} Yeah, you're right.  [frustrated] {disgustB} I wish I knew for sure how much food we have left.
57) LEE
[pickup2] {disgustA}{body-crouchAxe} You'll have to ask Lilly.  She's the one handling the rations.
58) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}{body-crouchAxe} Not enough.  According to Lilly we've just about hit the last of our food reserves. {thinkingA} Some people might have to go without tonight.
59) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA}{body-crouchAxe} We'll manage.
60) 
We'll manage.
61) 
Not enough.
62) MARK
[pickup2] {disgustA}{body-crouchRifle} Or mishandling it, if you ask Kenny.
63) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA} He's just worried about his kid getting enough. I worry about Clementine, too.
64) LEE
[pickup2] {disgustB} She thinks everyone should have an equal chance of missing a meal.
65) MARK
[pickup2] {disgustB}{body-crouchRifle} You mean "Lilly's Lottery" again. {disgustA} Kenny's gonna be pissed.
66) 
You'll have to ask Lilly.
67) MARK
[pickup2] {disgustA}{body-crouchRifle} Maybe. You know some people aren't too happy about the way Lilly is handling rations.
68) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingB} Lilly knows it's important to keep the adults fed and functioning. {disgustA} Sometimes that means someone's gotta miss a meal.
69) MARK
[pickup2][responding to lee's silence when asked "How much food is left?"] {disgustA}{body-crouchRifle} ...That much, huh? {sadA} Does Kenny know?
70) LEE
[pickup2] {disgustA}{body-crouchAxe} I don't know.[-if Kenny knows that we have no food left]
71) MARK
[pickup2] {angryA} Yeah, between the lack of food and Kenny & Lilly fighting all the time, {sadA} things are getting pretty tense back at the Motor Inn.
72) MARK
[pickup2] {thinkingA} You know Kenny's been talking about taking off if he can get that RV running.
73) LEE
[pickup2] {normalD}{body-crouchAxe} I sure hope so. [hoping kenny is having better luck hunting for food]
74) MARK
[pickup2] {normalA}{body-crouchRifle} You think Kenny's having any more luck than we are out here?
75) MARK
[pickup2] {sadA}{body-crouchRifle} Can't blame him, though - {disgustA} did you hear Larry going off on him last night? {thinkingB} What's the old guy's deal, anyway? {normalB} Seems like he's got a problem with you in particular.
76) 
He thinks I'm dangerous.
77) 
He's an old racist asshole.
78) 
He's just looking out for his daughter.
79) 
I have no idea.
80) LEE
[pickup2][Responding to "What's Larry's deal"?] {disgustA}{body-crouchAxe} He thinks I'm a danger to the group {thinkingB} and Clementine.
81) MARK
[pickup2] {thinkingB}{body-crouchRifle} I think he's the one putting us in danger. {angryA} The way Lilly worries about his health, I wouldn't be surprised if she's been skimming rations for him.
82) LEE
[pickup2][Responding to "What's Larry's deal"?] {angryA}{body-crouchAxe} He's just an old racist asshole, that's his deal.
83) MARK
[pickup2] {angryA}{body-crouchRifle} Well, he needs to get over that and start finding a way to pull his weight. {thinkingA} Heart problems or not, we should all be out here trying to find food.
84) MARK
[pickup2] {thinkingA}{body-crouchRifle} Hey, I know Lilly. {angryA} She can take care of herself. {thinkingA} He needs to take that energy and put it towards finding us some more food.
85) LEE
[pickup2][Responding to "What's Larry's deal?" with some reluctance & pride swallowing] {thinkingA}{body-crouchAxe} Larry's just{normalD} looking out for his daughter.
86) LEE
[pickup2][Responding to "What's Larry's deal"? - Just totally tired of dealing with Larry] {angryA}{body-crouchAxe} Who knows what Larry's problem is.
87) MARK
[pickup2] {thinkingA}{body-crouchRifle} Maybe that's just the way he is, {angryA}but that guy needs to chill out.
88) LEE
[pickup2][still weary from hunger] {normalC}{body-crouchAxe} Maybe you shouldn't have opened the door.
89) MARK
[pickup2][still weary from hunger - Mark is aiming his rifle at a bird in a tree] {thinkingB}{body-crouchRifle} Trust me.  If I don't think I can hit it, I won't shoot.

93) LEE
[pickup2][still weary from hunger - Mark is aiming his rifle at a bird in a tree] {disgustA}{body-crouchAxe} It's a long shot.  I'd hate to waste the bullets.

222) LILLY
[pickup2][Still angry, but sick of fighting]{angryB}You think this is easy for me? Everyone's starting to hate me because I'M the one that rations the food.  But NOBODY else wants to!
223) LILLY
